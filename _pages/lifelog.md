Not settle until i achieve this one goal, without settling for anything else

I'll write everything that happens here and everything that i do to track

12/09/25 (T - 154)

There will always be uncertainty and chaos lurking around the corner of your every waking hour, and that's the case for everyone. But, one can't give in and be complacent with it, to give that as an excuse, as that never leads to greatness or mastery over anything. You need to be stubborn and focussed enough to get what you said you would get done and make bold actions towards the goal you set upon. 

[Being a founding engineer at an AI startup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYN7ZULM84U)


Always First Principles thinking and approach;

i like things if they're said from first principles and build intuition and concept layer by layer, on top of each other. 


There is a way to do certain things, and that could be from what worked for others, what worked in that situations etc. But, you definitely need to make sure you add your personal touch in everything that you do. One, because its unique, you've leverage in this, as its your thing and yours only. Second, what else you're gonna do, if not adding your personal touch, to leave a mark in this world, you need to act and imprint in everything you do. Third, being genuine and real will be noticed by people in this world, as most of them just try to fit in. 

12/10/2025 (T - 153)

Woke up at 6AM, and adding this log at 6:13AM

Its normal to have confusion of what to do, since you haven't used to waking up early. Lets start small, you already have tabs open to read, pick any one of them and start the work. You can use speechify as well, don't think much if it'll be louder and disturbing to others, you've got a private room for this reason, so don't worry, and keep the focus in learning and working to achieve your goal of becoming a expert in ML systems, ML infra and GPU kernel optimization.

I now feel the importance of working with great and skilled people/engineers in the domain of ML systems. Because, one it transforms you completely, gives you lot of learnings and exposure in a very short duration. You get easily adapted to the thinking of people who are above you and skilled at what they do, if you be curious enough to ask and know and ruthless enough to execute and act with precision. Second, this is what is far worth more than doing things in silo, and just keep learing. You learn technically, but also the soft skills that comes as an added bonus. Also, I'm human and i need human connections for a sustained growth and living, so i take benefit for this too. So, overall, what i'm trying to tell is that, get/grab and opportunity to work with people in ML Systems for sure for the next semester, this is more immportant everything else. At the least, talk to professor, and work with her with a clear goal of what to accomplish, or work with the lab and their group. But, i should cold-email and work in a startup. Also, you don't feel this to be work, you can make money, you've great, and highly intelligent people out there to surround with, and this domain will persist for sure in the future, so go all in and work, code, learn and strive for excellency.

Again, i insist, keep genuinely working on things you like(ML systems), keep showing up, create value by what works for you(from your strenghts, do more experimentation to find this out, and keep doing), and eventually, you'll see people, opportunities come by, even faster than you've thought. So, its true that, where there is will, there is a way. 

Solve Interesting Technical Work

The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is the psychological concept that people quickly return to a stable baseline level of happiness despite major positive or negative life events.

Its easy to feel overwhelmed with everything, and the one working antidote, i found is to learn and work deeply, instead of content consumption. 

You don't need to significantly think about everyone. All you need care and take care of is you, your career, your well-being and betterment and your family, friends. The order and priority decreases as you go down this list, and its absolutely fine and right, if you're not able to get everything well thought for everyone. Because, one, its not all in your control, only your life, action and destiny are in your control, second, let them do their work, and help only if they ask for, and when you think they might terribely need that, else there isn't much value to the help, thrid, energy and time are limited, use it wisely and mostly 99% on yourself for your improvement and betterment. As its said, fill your cup first, let them take the overflow. There should no guilt or regret in this aspect.

There involves a lot of courage to ask for help for someone like me. 

PhD thoughts, industry work etc - I was giving my BDML presentation today, it went well and i felt really good about my part of the presentation, i was relaxed and steering the right way, and conveyed clearly what i intended to present. Professor said its cool and great of the work we've done, and some students also came and told that it's a good presentation. Overall, good, and now, lets the other pending thing is report.
Also, i think, i hold a good image from the professor, so can confidenty approach her for ML systems work. 
There were two presentations, both by phd students, they'we really good, in a sense that they think from first principles and try to understand and investigate the reasoning behind their work, which i find to be very great. I wish to do the same, and they and similar people inspire the idea of pursuing a phd, especially in ML systems, ML infra, and GPU kernel optimization, as that's something i love to do now and learn more out of curiousity myself. But, phd can weight, i want to get into the industry and gain practical experience, and that matters, given the cost, and time. I can do phd, but that should be once, i earn something, and gaining experience matters more than anything for me now. 

Specialising is important, job search must follow it, rather than being independent. - This is again, i was having in mind, with all the AI automation, all they can do is the general, surface level tasks, and we need experts even to guide them the right way, and we obviously need experts to build systems, and that level of competency gives you moat. Don't apply randomly, apply for big-tech and apply for startups(that you want to work for genuinely), do cold-mail and share your interest in working with them, and be as specific as possible. Learn more about their work and how you can contribute. Yesterday, i watched podcast of founders, similarly, watch podcasts of founders and startups, i'm interested in and gather data points, by which you could align your cold-email, and that will be noticeable. 

[Why deep expertise is the secret to success for today’s entrepreneurs](https://www.fastcompany.com/91454854/entrepreneurs-deep-domain-expertise-secret-success)

Key idea of the above article: The new entrepreneurial opportunity lies not in disrupting entire industries, but in becoming the undisputed authority in a problem space in which your specialized knowledge defines your competitive advantage. This isn’t about slipping under the radar or being too small to notice. It’s about being so specialized—so clearly the expert—that you effectively build a moat around your niche.

Ping Sohan for update, accountability and mentor. First, thanked him for all the knowledge he's sharing and then asked for me sharing bi-weekly updates. He's someone i look upto and want to surrounded by such people and their skills, worh-ethic, hunger to be better in every aspect of life. 

What you consume matters and how to replace something matters.  
This is something, that crossed my mind. Its actually true, i need focus on this, and documenting gives me that ability. I can read articles that gives me new perspectives, new ideas, keep me updated, know about people who are great in their field, and i can rely on youtube to listen to long podcasts again for the same. And in the other time, i can work on my ML sys, especially, i want learn transformers end to end now, i feel that urge, and i want to do that now. And when you want to socialize, talk with people, surround and occupy with ideas that propel you forward and help you fly high.

Dissatisfaction comes from lack of work, efforts and experimentation.
This again, is something i see to be true. If you experiment and find what is something that you wish to do, can earn from it and surround yourself with great people, then that will give me satisfaction and it does for someone like me. Without this, following randow or general paths, will lead to dissatisfaction. So, outwork yourself on this to find what truely matters to you and go all in, once your thing clicks, you don't need to nudge yourself from then on, as your genuine interest and curiousity drives you. But, the initial part is in your hands and you need to act.

What you create is a honest relection of who you are - Naval
Such a true statement. Sohan posted this in whatsapp.

Good morning!

Thoughts about over-sharing and not sharing wth family and friends, expand;

Learning it in-depth, going back to first priciples, must do.

Sohan accepted for me to share my updates(bi-weekly) and milestones with him, will send an email by EOD and will create a reminder for this in my calender.

[Obsession](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-08-24-obsession.html)
- In your professional and personal life, I don't believe there is a stronger motivation than having something in mind and the desire to do it. Yet the natural way to deal with a desire to do something is to justify why it's not possible.
- In the best cases, my listener had the self-confidence to ignore me. They did what they wanted to do anyway. In the worst case, again to my deep regret, I've been a well-intentioned part of derailing someone's career for years.
- Nobody wants to be convinced. But intelligent people will change their mind when exposed to new facts or different ideas. Being convinced is a battle of will. Changing one's mind is a purely personal decision.
- There are certainly people with discipline who can grind on things they hate doing and eventually become experts at it. But more often I see people grind on things they hate only to become depressed and give up.
- For most of us, our best hope is (healthy) obsession. And obsession, in the sense I'm talking about, does not come from something you are ambivalent about or hate. Obsession can only come when you're doing something you actually want to do.
- For big goals or big changes, you need regular commitment weekly, monthly, yearly. Over the course of years. And only obsession makes that work not actually feel like work. Obsession is the only thing that makes discipline not feel like discipline.
- That big goals take years to accomplish need not be scary. Obsession doesn't mean you can't pivot. There is quite a lot to gain by committing to something regularly over the course of years even if you decide to stop and commit from then on to something else. You will learn a good deal.
- And healthy obsession to me is more specifically measurable on the order of weeks, not hours or days. Healthy obsession means you're still building healthy personal and professional relationships. You're still taking care of yourself, emotionally and physically.
- I think you can do almost anything you want to do. If you commit to do doing it.

[feeder.co](https://feeder.co/reader?addParentFolderId=folder%2F2017914) - added people's pages of the blogs that i enjoyed and wanted to follow their work.

I've this RBDA presentation. I've other things to do, but since this appears to a big think, i'm not able to shift my focus and at the same time can't keep doing RBDA for long. Let's try to see some youtube video to shift focus, learn something, and then come back to RBDA again.

Did the presentation, and was looking for validation from others even though i know that i did good. Not sure, why yet, but no need to worry. Other things came up and i completely forgot about that. 

Two things to do by EOD, send Sohan the updates email, set reminder to maintain that thread, post in brightspace for tmr's office hrs in zoom. - Done

Subject: Updates on my progress with Sohan

Hello Sohan,

I hope you’re doing well! Thank you for accepting this invitation for me to share my progress and help hold me accountable. I’ll keep this brief, and please let me know if you have any structure in mind to keep things streamlined. I want to make this process as smooth as possible for both of us.

Current Progress and Milestones:

As we wrap up the semester, I am currently working on my final projects and presentations, and I have an exam scheduled for next week, for which I am preparing. Earlier, I talked with you about what to focus on and select for my course project. I’m happy to say that I’ve made significant progress and am quite satisfied with my work. 

There are two main highlights: First, I have discovered my interest in ML systems and GPU programming. Second, we completed a project that is very specific and addresses an industry problem, which we believe adds significant value. I’ve attached a report of the final project for your reference.

Additionally, I was a bit reserved when it came to talking to people and presenting, but this semester, I made a conscious effort to break out of that. I served as a Teaching Assistant for Calculus 1, prepared thoroughly, presented well, and took notes after each session to identify areas for improvement. I plan to revisit these notes and write a blog about this unique experience (I enjoy blogging: (monishver11.github.io.io)). I also voluntarily took on presenter roles in my course projects and made notes for further improvements after each opportunity. Overall, this semester has felt positive. I've begun to adjust to life in New York, and I want to work with the amazing people around.

Next Milestones:

My primary goal is to work and gain experience in the domains of ML systems, ML infrastructure, or GPU kernel optimisation. I am determined to secure a co-op position for the next semester, so I will start making focused efforts to reach out to professionals in these fields through cold emails and build solid work around it. 

Secondly, during the winter break, I plan to begin code problem-solving not just to prepare for interviews, but to hone my skills genuinely. I have not made specific plans yet, but I will do so soon. Concurrently, I will focus on interview preparation and building my experience in the domains I mentioned.

I believe I’ve covered everything here. I apologise for any lack of structure in my thoughts, and I’ll aim to be more concise in the future. I'll send my next update on 12/26/2025. Thank you for your time, and I would love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you might have. 

Best,  
Monishver  


Ask in Calculus 1 group chat for HW grading split; - Done
Make a reminder(both in system and visual) for next update with Sohan. Also add a reminder to add a section for things i enjoyed and you might like too, to the same email thread. - Made a sticky note and pasted in the feild of vision and that's enough and works well. 

Add everything you learn here.

Good morning Monish! 
New alarm worked perfectly. 

My friend booked tickets to India, so now both of my flatmates are going to India. Its fine for me, but there is this feeling of missing out, atleast that's the very vague i can put of this feeling, i still can't comprehend why or what is my thinking in these lines, but i'm spilling it out here.

You need to experiment in the real world(and not in your head) constantly to reinvent yourself with what works for you and what works for the outer space. So, act and make an action.

- You can feel grateful for opportunities and still grieve the moments you miss.
- You can be ambitious and still have big emotions.

Hi Nanna 2023

12/14/2025 (T - 149)

Time is now 1:02 PM. I didn't wake up in the morning as I did something that tires me to a point that i didn't even hear the alarm. I'm not regretting this anymore, there is a need, and it needs to be satisfied. So, i can't deny that need, its not a sustainable way, i need to look out for something that is good, at the same time satisfies the need and also, boosts in the way of my goal. The only concern for me, is not that i did this, it caused me my morning, and the associated efforts i would have get done. 
To-do: search for an alternative that doesn't cross path with my goal. Update here;

Decide what you want so badly Monish. You can't have both, especially the ones that you have in mind, as those are just opposing ends of the spectrum. Saying that itself is a mistake, one shouldn't be in the spectrum or field of view itself. You need to be obsessed with your thing, so as to nothing matters, and that's how a precision instrument with ruthlessness,  methodical thinking and a wild beast is forged and built.   

Your energy is more important for your goals, than anything else. 

This is not a reflection of the anger/frustation, but what?
I think, i've so many things to do, and i'm not doing it, partly, because i'm tired due to yesterday's action.

Went through the first draft for BDML report, generated by claude, and passed whatever changes to be made to my teammate.

Will start with the Calc-1 grading now, and need to reply to a students question in mail;

Was clearning the snow along the pathway. This was new, and i kind of enjoyed it, but due to yesterday's actions, i was very tired and wasn't able to do much. Also, feels like my mind is cluttered with something like noise, and i don't like it. Last week was very structured and i enjoyed my work. All this is to say that, i need to find a way to stop this and replace with something that keeps the mind, body, soul and work attunated towards the goal.

Grading is again tiring, and i'm judging the student's work, which i shouldn't, as its the work i'm ought to do, as i'm getting paid for this. So, do your work the right way and don't complain even within yourself.

Me doing the grading, gives me a different persepective now. I've been waiting for my own grades, which is the other side of the fence, and i had put som much work into such material, then i start expecting, but the grader, doesn't care much, as he has to finish grading for a lot of students and will just slide by every homework. Its the way it is, so the crux is sometime, the bare minimum is sufficient and present it decently well enough.

Listening to songs, while grading. 
Was mostly listening to sad songs, as that's what i wished to hear now. Abdur came to check(on this), but i told him that it's because of the grading. But, truth to be told, it's not that, and its something only i know and no one will ever understand, or may be i still haven't made to put in the right words, to the right person.

Had dinner, and now listening to good melody songs, across languages, may old favorites, and along with that old memories(something that reminds me of what i still miss).

Less work done, and its reflected in workog. One way its good, as i can track now and make changes to my next day and make focused efforts for my goals.

Just that one song, even the thought, and then listening to it, totally caught my mind off, with the past, something i can't do anything about it. It hurts.

Grading isn't something that i won't do ig. So much repeated work, and without much purpose to it. Maybe, i was cramping most of it in one day, but its just feels of no use for me and the students. Maybe, some go through this again, but not many.

Done with grading.

Today is something that is so incomparable with any other day, one reason could be i'm penning it down with all my raw thoughts ig. But anyway, done with the day, will talk to mom and sleep.

Need to start RBDA exam tmr;

Good morning Monish!

Starting in the morning, gives me a good flow for my work towards the goal, and it gives me whole-hearted and unique satisfaction, which i love truly.

Get ready for college and final exam invigilation.

Talked to Mom, was restless a bit until i was having that call. Not much, but feels good once i talk.

Finished proctoring, returned. Cooked Pasta for all(i decided it to).

A few thoughts, while protoring, but wrote later while coming to home in train;

Age like a fine wine, me and the person I’m wishing. I want someone who's mature, and has rekindled the inner child(if they had lost along the way), and someone intellectual with genuine depth. 

Judging aggravates with exposure and reduce with experiences. I wrote it because, i did start to judge some people(based on intellectually), and i don't think i'll compromise on this. So, this pretty much aligns with the main goal i've, to work on ML Sys and focus on my career. As there, the people are exactly amazing and i don't need to compromise either. So, it's a win-win.

Social skills, how to react to situations and people in general. There’s more to it, what and how we act naturally, and it has a lot of correlation as you go up the ladder, a must to know skill and compounding one, similar to the way communication matters.

Modified resume to include the opensource work, and shared it with Nithese for NVIDIA referral.

Completed the Ramp assessment, took help of LLM, didn't think through the problem much of myself. Need to stop this, and not do it again. You need to understand, think and solve.

Good morning Monish. All the best for your new semester. My best wishes for you to land your dream job in GPU kernel optimization, ML systems and ML Infra by the time you're graduating this year. 

Started with CP-31 list; Spent good 30 mins thinking, and got a brute force solution. But, it didn't pass all the test cases. After 30 mins, saw the hints, and understood without seeing the code. Coded the solution and got it accepted. Feels good, to think through and get the spark of finding when the solution clicks.
