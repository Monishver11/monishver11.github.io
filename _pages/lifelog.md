Not settle until i achieve this one goal, without settling for anything else

I'll write everything that happens here and everything that i do to track

There will always be uncertainty and chaos lurking around the corner of your every waking hour, and that's the case for everyone. But, one can't give in and be complacent with it, to give that as an excuse, as that never leads to greatness or mastery over anything. You need to be stubborn and focussed enough to get what you said you would get done and make bold actions towards the goal you set upon.

Always First Principles thinking and approach;

i like things if they're said from first principles and build intuition and concept layer by layer, on top of each other. 


There is a way to do certain things, and that could be from what worked for others, what worked in that situations etc. But, you definitely need to make sure you add your personal touch in everything that you do. One, because its unique, you've leverage in this, as its your thing and yours only. Second, what else you're gonna do, if not adding your personal touch, to leave a mark in this world, you need to act and imprint in everything you do. Third, being genuine and real will be noticed by people in this world, as most of them just try to fit in.

Woke up at 6AM, and adding this log at 6:13AM

Its normal to have confusion of what to do, since you haven't used to waking up early. Lets start small, you already have tabs open to read, pick any one of them and start the work. You can use speechify as well, don't think much if it'll be louder and disturbing to others, you've got a private room for this reason, so don't worry, and keep the focus in learning and working to achieve your goal of becoming a expert in ML systems, ML infra and GPU kernel optimization.

I now feel the importance of working with great and skilled people/engineers in the domain of ML systems. Because, one it transforms you completely, gives you lot of learnings and exposure in a very short duration. You get easily adapted to the thinking of people who are above you and skilled at what they do, if you be curious enough to ask and know and ruthless enough to execute and act with precision. Second, this is what is far worth more than doing things in silo, and just keep learing. You learn technically, but also the soft skills that comes as an added bonus. Also, I'm human and i need human connections for a sustained growth and living, so i take benefit for this too. So, overall, what i'm trying to tell is that, get/grab and opportunity to work with people in ML Systems for sure for the next semester, this is more immportant everything else. At the least, talk to professor, and work with her with a clear goal of what to accomplish, or work with the lab and their group. But, i should cold-email and work in a startup. Also, you don't feel this to be work, you can make money, you've great, and highly intelligent people out there to surround with, and this domain will persist for sure in the future, so go all in and work, code, learn and strive for excellency.

Again, i insist, keep genuinely working on things you like(ML systems), keep showing up, create value by what works for you(from your strenghts, do more experimentation to find this out, and keep doing), and eventually, you'll see people, opportunities come by, even faster than you've thought. So, its true that, where there is will, there is a way. 

Solve Interesting Technical Work

The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is the psychological concept that people quickly return to a stable baseline level of happiness despite major positive or negative life events.

Its easy to feel overwhelmed with everything, and the one working antidote, i found is to learn and work deeply, instead of content consumption. 

You don't need to significantly think about everyone. All you need care and take care of is you, your career, your well-being and betterment and your family, friends. The order and priority decreases as you go down this list, and its absolutely fine and right, if you're not able to get everything well thought for everyone. Because, one, its not all in your control, only your life, action and destiny are in your control, second, let them do their work, and help only if they ask for, and when you think they might terribely need that, else there isn't much value to the help, thrid, energy and time are limited, use it wisely and mostly 99% on yourself for your improvement and betterment. As its said, fill your cup first, let them take the overflow. There should no guilt or regret in this aspect.

There involves a lot of courage to ask for help for someone like me. 

PhD thoughts, industry work etc - I was giving my BDML presentation today, it went well and i felt really good about my part of the presentation, i was relaxed and steering the right way, and conveyed clearly what i intended to present. Professor said its cool and great of the work we've done, and some students also came and told that it's a good presentation. Overall, good, and now, lets the other pending thing is report.
Also, i think, i hold a good image from the professor, so can confidenty approach her for ML systems work. 
There were two presentations, both by phd students, they'we really good, in a sense that they think from first principles and try to understand and investigate the reasoning behind their work, which i find to be very great. I wish to do the same, and they and similar people inspire the idea of pursuing a phd, especially in ML systems, ML infra, and GPU kernel optimization, as that's something i love to do now and learn more out of curiousity myself. But, phd can weight, i want to get into the industry and gain practical experience, and that matters, given the cost, and time. I can do phd, but that should be once, i earn something, and gaining experience matters more than anything for me now. 

Specialising is important, job search must follow it, rather than being independent. - This is again, i was having in mind, with all the AI automation, all they can do is the general, surface level tasks, and we need experts even to guide them the right way, and we obviously need experts to build systems, and that level of competency gives you moat. Don't apply randomly, apply for big-tech and apply for startups(that you want to work for genuinely), do cold-mail and share your interest in working with them, and be as specific as possible. Learn more about their work and how you can contribute. Yesterday, i watched podcast of founders, similarly, watch podcasts of founders and startups, i'm interested in and gather data points, by which you could align your cold-email, and that will be noticeable.

Key idea of the above article: The new entrepreneurial opportunity lies not in disrupting entire industries, but in becoming the undisputed authority in a problem space in which your specialized knowledge defines your competitive advantage. This isn’t about slipping under the radar or being too small to notice. It’s about being so specialized—so clearly the expert—that you effectively build a moat around your niche.

Ping Sohan for update, accountability and mentor. First, thanked him for all the knowledge he's sharing and then asked for me sharing bi-weekly updates. He's someone i look upto and want to surrounded by such people and their skills, worh-ethic, hunger to be better in every aspect of life. 

What you consume matters and how to replace something matters.  
This is something, that crossed my mind. Its actually true, i need focus on this, and documenting gives me that ability. I can read articles that gives me new perspectives, new ideas, keep me updated, know about people who are great in their field, and i can rely on youtube to listen to long podcasts again for the same. And in the other time, i can work on my ML sys, especially, i want learn transformers end to end now, i feel that urge, and i want to do that now. And when you want to socialize, talk with people, surround and occupy with ideas that propel you forward and help you fly high.

Dissatisfaction comes from lack of work, efforts and experimentation.
This again, is something i see to be true. If you experiment and find what is something that you wish to do, can earn from it and surround yourself with great people, then that will give me satisfaction and it does for someone like me. Without this, following randow or general paths, will lead to dissatisfaction. So, outwork yourself on this to find what truely matters to you and go all in, once your thing clicks, you don't need to nudge yourself from then on, as your genuine interest and curiousity drives you. But, the initial part is in your hands and you need to act.

What you create is a honest relection of who you are - Naval
Such a true statement. Sohan posted this in whatsapp.
