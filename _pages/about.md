A quick intro: I’m a graduate student in Computer Science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University. Before this, I worked as a Data Engineer at IBM in India for two years. My aspiration is to become a `Machine Learning Engineer/Researcher`, and this blog is my digital garden—a space to reflect, document my journey, and share insights. It’s meant not just for me but also for anyone navigating a similar path or aspiring to achieve the same goal. For more context, check out the next section (_Motivation_).

On a personal note, I’m still discovering who I am. As an `INFJ` (if you know, you know), I value introspection, meaningful connections, and a sense of purpose. While most of my posts will delve into technical topics, I promise to keep things focused—no unnecessary drama here! :)

I find satisfaction in making/seeing others happy and accomplishing goals after long, challenging journeys, even though those moments of triumph can be fleeting at times. Nevertheless, it is essential for continued growth in life. Beyond this, I cherish deep conversations and spending time with loved ones. My interests are broad, and I approach life with an open and curious mind. Off the academic path, I’m an avid lawn tennis player with a deep passion for art. You can check out my creations on IG: @knotted.arts.

This blog is also my way of reaching out, adding value to others lives, and fostering meaningful connections. If any of this resonates with you, don’t hesitate to reach out—I’d love to chat! At the end of the day, we only have one life. Let’s focus on the journey ahead, let go of regrets and worries, and invest in building meaningful relationships and memories.

**Motivation**

- **Building Foundations**: To develop a strong understanding of machine learning through `first principles`.
- **Tracking Progress**: To document my journey as a way to reflect, revise, and measure growth.
- **Simplifying Complexity**: To make intricate concepts in machine learning more approachable, enabling others to form intuition and engage deeply with the field.
- **Problem-Solving**: To focus on understanding and tackling challenges, as `problem-solving` in ML requires clarity of thought and creativity.
- **Collaboration**: To connect and work with brilliant minds while embracing the fulfilling challenge of mastering machine learning.
- **Self-Expression**: To articulate my thoughts and ideas through writing, which helps me think clearly, align my perspectives, and grow while helping others along the way.

I’m committed to making this blog a valuable resource for myself and anyone pursuing a career in machine learning. Thank you for stopping by—feel free to connect, and let’s make this journey together an enriching one.

Best wishes and see you around!
