T - X Days

Coffee + Article Read + Standing

Coding - ML Systems & GPU

Coding - Problem Solving (Try for 30 mins minimum) + Learning the approach

Routine & Discipline

Document the work each day, what you learnt, express in writing.

Specialized in-depth knowledge about ML Systems and GPU Kernel writing

Ruthless work-ethic

Always First Principles thinking and approach;

GPU kernels for MOE, refined idea using first principles, and then proceeded to claude code. Now, will read and understand the code better and will see what to do next.

Slides for BDML presentation - Done, will prepare for the presentation tmr morning and will do 2 dry run of the content i want to present.

Have some doubts in the above blog's Triton coding parts, will check them using LLM and understand after BDML presentation.

Solve Interesting Technical Work, again and always from first principles;

I need to code here, from scratch and on my own. I feel this to a be big lacking and decrease in confidence level. Need to start doing even small things, but do it myself.
