These notions are ruminations and realizations as I walk through my journey of life. Some may be inspired by others, and you might find connections to different ideas or directly to individuals, which I find relatable and interesting. I feel most of them arise from the human-made complexities of life, which is something we’re doomed to live by with all its richness.

Some of it could be happy, sad, or whatever form human emotions may take, and these thoughts could take any of those forms when I pen them down. The exact thought is forever with the one penning it down, for god knows what reason.

Everyone sees life through their unique lens and the experiences they’ve gained in the time being, and that opens and closes doors for them to move forward. I wish more people took the time to see more holistically what life has to offer.

This is my way of sharing my learnings as I navigate and explore this world for all it has to offer.

I truly believe there are people out there who will resonate with one another, even in the slightest ways and that’s the beauty of it. We’re all unique in subtle ways, yet often separated by distances for which we haven’t found meaningful ways to bridge connection.

So, if you have thoughts that are raw, genuine, and come from a place that doesn’t intend harm - express them.

As it’s said: this is life, your life, and your only life - so live it to the fullest.

<div class="small-quote"><p><strong>Maybe you haven’t fallen in love yet, but haven't you fallen for the thought of love every single time?</strong></p></div>

<div class="small-quote"><p>Is love a wishful curiosity to be willing to know and willing to share each other’s journey? And is it up to the journey to surprise you with what may unfold?</p></div>

<div class="small-quote"><p>Indeed, to love someone truly is a long, very long walk in life. It’s hard, but soul-enriching, and only some can afford to endure it last. Why so? Maybe it’s because we’ve to face our own inner demons along the way, to acknowledge them and pacify them. Maybe it’s to lose your ego. Maybe it’s to love without reciprocity at times. Maybe it’s just to be there and empathise, even though you wish the same. Maybe it’s to know the fine line between giving them their personal space without encroaching. More maybes and maybe whatnot. Anyone can start the walk, but can you walk all the way through, to know yourself better, to know the other person better, to share lives together and …?</p></div>

<div class="small-quote"><p>Why do we romanticise life? Why do we try to justify everything with meaning and in accordance with god, belief, religion, faith and hope? Isn’t life just and only just the present moment stripped of everything else? Maybe it’s hard to digest that we choose to ignore and believe the things that make living worthwhile.</p></div>

<div class="small-quote"><p>Love is truly imperfectly perfect.</p></div>

<div class="small-quote"><p><strong>People have to do what they need to do and what they like to do. Nothing else, nothing much and its not a either one option.</strong></p></div>

<div class="small-quote"><p>Be welcoming to people. Some might hold the treasure within, like you and might be willing to share as well, but only if you let yourself allow it.</p></div>

<div class="small-quote"><p>Life isn’t supposed to be a movie for us to be a hero/heroine. Instead, I think of it as we being the protagonist, trying to create and build our story to tell to the world, share some spaces with our close ones' stories, and try to make the best one out of what we can. Some parts may not be as attractive as others, but the whole is much beautiful than the parts.</p></div>

<div class="small-quote"><p>If we can’t find meaning in what we set out to do, we make meaning out of what we got. Because the meaninglessness of life isn’t glorified yet.</p></div>

<div class="small-quote"><p>We’re all lying about something to ourselves. But who are we really trying to fool with this?</p></div>

<div class="small-quote"><p>Being true to yourself and following your heart unravels innumerous gifts in life, and one of its greatest is wisdom.</p></div>

<div class="small-quote"><p>There something as depths of the person. Only some can withstand the pressure at such depths so as even dare try to enter it and only a very few can possibly acclimatise and thrive.</p></div>

<div class="small-quote"><p>Haven’t we all got work to do with our emotions at least?</p></div>

<div class="small-quote"><p>If predominantly, men want purpose and support, and women want safety and trust. Where and how does love fit in this picture? Or it’s the invisible natural force that binds everything together where they were meant to be.</p></div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Does the true self get blurred in the facade we play to live by and fit in?</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Some can’t afford to be temperamental with the portrayal of their anger. People can bear what rouses out of them, but not others.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Is life all about outgrowing ourselves out of every circumstance we’ve got ourselves into? And learning, feeling, and understanding are all just part of this process?</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>The complexity of human connections arises from the mental complexes that we’ve unknowingly acquired as we grow.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>The perceptual rigidity of self and the world is the most powerful limiting factor there is, and even supersedes and magnifies all socioeconomic factors.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>If you look at human nature and history, our perception of time was very predictable. But we live as we don’t abide by it, only to experience most of it ourselves all over again. And as always, some exceptions push boundaries, but not too far yet and all at once.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>All that you miss to feel at the moment is added to the backlog for you to feel later, which mostly turns into an emotional burden that’s hard to feel and regret.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>The delicacy of one’s heart commands the kind of fortress that will be forged upon to guard it.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Our fragile hearts are placed within the ribs of the body. It’s also called the rib cage. Now, my heart fathoms why so and what for.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>The sanctity of your conscience must neither be misused nor compromised by anyone, and you’ve to know it first, protect it, and even fight for it.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Both fixating on oneself and refraining from the social nature of humankind lead to loss of self.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>If the contingency of human nature is to never settle, then why do we want to settle in life before a certain age set by society or someone else’s?</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p><strong>Why is it that love is so special? Is it that we weren’t insignificant in the eyes of the person, even though we’re to the world?</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>We’re always at a loss for words when it comes to explaining our love. And we’ve gracefully accepted it to acknowledge that we can’t. To confine and encapsulate it isn't totally achievable as the true essence is only ever known, felt and lies between the souls of the receiver and the giver.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>What are your thoughts on life? There are so many aspects to it that I always get lost in its wilderness.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Craft it so well that it’s hard to be unnoticed.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p><strong>How can parents endure the unrequited love of children as they age? How does this attachment get transformed? I’m guilty of it, and I guess many unknowingly. That love to them is something they deserve more than we ever can know.</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Questions and doubts arise only for those who’re in the middle of the ocean. Ignore and keep swimming. If you want to take a little rest, then float and don’t drown. You already know what one end looks like, and there’s no point in returning back.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>What does it mean to love? What does it mean to be loved? Finally, what is love? Is the answer a trifecta of these three united? You tell?</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Often startled by the peculiarities of life, only to rediscover myself more and over.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Learn different perspectives. Not to judge but to understand the reality that people often miss to see in one another. Give equal importance as you would for experiencing something new, because it actually is.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>At some point in life, you ought to acknowledge the privilege you got to have. Only then can you detach yourself from it and see what it has made you as a person and what it has made someone devoid of it. Anyone’s world is never the same, even with it, but not accepting this blinds you from ever being able to truly understand the other world.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>I feel that we’re so complex and profound beyond any of our comprehension yet.</p>
</div>


<div class="small-quote">
  <p><strong>Life seems to be a river, and we are a small twig. It emerges from a source and ends in a sink. A twig empowered by wind and other twigs, by things that push, and by obstacles to either fight through or take as hints to redirect. It’s up to the twig to use what it has to work its way to the bank it desires. And as a twig is part of the big tree, you carry with you the traits of it. You can stop at any bank you want with the effort to reach it, but the flow of the river still takes you through all the stages of life one by one and at the right time. Sometimes your river can be entirely different from the one someone else is riding. But two things are common anyway: you’ll drift with the life of the river and end up in the oneness sink of the ocean. Just try not to hold on to a single bank, take in as much as you need and go with the flow with the drift you want to have.</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Focus empowers, and drifting dilutes the power of manifestation.</p>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>It’s quite paradoxical yet amazing that we’re infinitesimal in this universe and hold a vastness within ourselves that’s beyond any richness the universe can offer.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Why do we miss out on living life, to see its rich, bright, beautiful, amazing colours? Where and what are we running for if we don’t even have time to sit, think, and enjoy the present? I don’t have an answer and don’t intend to find one. Instead, I’ll live my life in the present with whatever it has to offer. No thinking or searching for an answer will equal it.</p>

###### **July 2025**

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Love and death are the only two things to be left for destiny to handle. All others are up to you to make up in your life. That’s the freedom we get to enjoy.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>We need to take turns and switch roles rather than wear masks in the situations and circumstances of life. Being you is the freedom that you always have, and you can take attitudes and behave in the best way possible.</p>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Everyone and no one except yourself holds power over your thoughts. And it’s up to you to choose.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Today, human actions aren’t bound by the universality of nature as they used to be. But if we can possibly and unitedly agree on at least one thing, then it’s attainable and leads to a better balance.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>You may find yourself to be a culmination of different personalities that resonate, relate, admire, hate, and have likes and dislikes similar to you. Similarly, some may find parts of you within them, and if you attain fame, more people may find your pieces in them. So, if you take all of them and piece them together, there is no way to connect them all to make you the way you are. That missing connection is your unique personality that you need to build and strengthen.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Right intent protects you. It’s like the shade that assists you in your long, hard path. It also inhibits unwanted thoughts that may drain your energy.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p>Find your interpretation of ‘Balance’. For someone, following a proper routine is balance. At the same time, there is someone who works tirelessly for days and then takes the same amount as rest. Both may be odd and extreme to each other, but that is what they find to be balance for them—and neither is wrong. Find your sweet spot.</p>
</div>

<div class="small-quote">
  <p><strong>We really don’t have to worry about anything that’s on the emotional side as long as the sun’s gonna rise the next morning. It’s quite strange that what you feel deeply today and find very hard to experience is about to fade or be forgotten, and always loses its power over you.</strong></p>

    <p>If you're building your voice right now, don't chase followers. Don't chase reach. Say what you mean. Sharpen your inner filter. Speak from silence, not from strategy.</p>

    <p>Your mind will keep you up at night, make you cry, destroy you over and over again. You need to convince your mind that it has to let go…because your heart already knows how to heal.</p>

    <p>I only wanted to share just one of the many questions leading their lonely existence in my soul.</p>
    <span class="author">- Kappus</span>
    <p>I want to ask you, dear sir, as best I can, to have patience about everything that is still unresolved in your heart; try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms, like books written in a truly foreign language. Don't look for the answers now: they cannot be given to you yet because you cannot yet live them, and what matters is to live everything. For now, live the questions. If you do, then maybe, gradually, without your realizing it, some far-off day you will live your way into the answer.</p>
    <span class="author">- Rilke</span>
    <p>In the spirit of Rilke, we can learn to avoid the addictive appeal of fast, easy answers. Loving the questions is a practice that's seldom pursued, challenging to sustain, and utterly transformational.</p>
