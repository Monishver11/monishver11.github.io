#### **Welcome to My Machine Learning Blog Series!**

This blog series draws inspiration from my machine learning course at NYUâ€”a graduate-level adventure designed to explore concepts deeply and build a strong foundation from scratch. A solid grasp of the fundamentals is essential for mastering advanced topics and making meaningful progress. The course was initially designed by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YsHFgSAAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. David Rosenburg</a> and later adapted by **Prof. He He**, **Tal Linzen**, and others. I had the privilege of learning under <a href="https://mengyeren.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Mengye Ren</a>, whose teaching and structured content have greatly influenced this blog series.

A heartfelt thank you to everyone who has supported me, continues to support me, or will support me in the future. Iâ€™m incredibly grateful for all the experiences that have brought me to this point in my journey.

#### **What to Expect in This Blog Series**

The focus here is on the **theoretical aspects** of machine learning rather than programming. Why? Because understanding theory forms the critical intuition that separates a beginner randomly trying things from an expert who knows exactly where to focus for impactful results. While I consider myself a beginner, Iâ€™m determined to keep learning, growing, and sharing insights along the way.

Since **mathematics forms the backbone** of machine learning and much of computer science, Iâ€™ll ensure no critical details are overlooked. For challenging or abstract concepts, Iâ€™ll include **analogies** to help you remember them more easily. 

<!-- For key topics, expect to see discussions about their real-world applications, **industry relevance**, and **tips and tricks** that can significantly boost performance, along with the reasoning behind why they work.

While the focus is theoretical, I wonâ€™t leave you hanging! Iâ€™ll include **code snippets** and **programming references** for topics where information isnâ€™t easily accessible online or through tools like ChatGPT -->

If youâ€™re someone with undergraduate-level knowledge in mathematics and programming, youâ€™ll find this series accessible. While topics like Convex optimization or Lagrangians might not be covered in standard undergraduate curricula, donâ€™t worryâ€”Iâ€™ll explain them in detail as we go along.

<!-- #### **Attention to Detail and Collaboration**

Every blog post will include a list of **references** Iâ€™ve read or used while preparing the content. I plan to thoroughly review each post multiple times before publishing, incorporating feedback from classmates and my professor to ensure accuracy. If you spot any mistakes, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach outâ€”Iâ€™d be thrilled to correct them and keep this content as reliable as possible. -->

#### **A Lifelong Learning Project**

This blog series is more than just a projectâ€”itâ€™s a lifelong commitment. My goal is to gradually evolve this resource as I publish posts one by one. Iâ€™ll strive to remain consistent and ensure this series not only serves as a learning resource but also inspires more people to dive into machine learning and contribute to the community.

Itâ€™s time to get to workâ€”fingers crossed!

Thank you for being part of this journey. See you in the next post! ðŸ‘‹
