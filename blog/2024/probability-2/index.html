It provides a mathematical framework to update our beliefs about a hypothesis based on new evidence.</p> <h4 id="what-is-bayes-rule"><strong>What is Bayes’ Rule?</strong></h4> <p>Bayes’ Rule describes the relationship between conditional probabilities. It allows us to reverse conditional probabilities, which can be very useful in machine learning when we need to compute the probability of a certain hypothesis given observed data.</p> <p>Mathematically, Bayes’ Rule is expressed as:</p> \[P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>\(P(A \mid B)\) is the <strong>posterior probability</strong>: the probability of the hypothesis \(A\) being true given the evidence \(B\).</li> <li>\(P(B \mid A)\) is the <strong>likelihood</strong>: the probability of observing the evidence \(B\) given that the hypothesis \(A\) is true.</li> <li>\(P(A)\) is the <strong>prior probability</strong>: the initial probability of the hypothesis \(A\) before seeing any evidence.</li> <li>\(P(B)\) is the <strong>evidence</strong> or <strong>normalizing constant</strong>: the total probability of observing the evidence across all possible hypotheses.</li> </ul> <p><strong>To follow along, consider this analogy:</strong></p> <p>Imagine you’re trying to diagnose whether someone has a certain disease. You have:</p> <ul> <li>The prior probability of having the disease (\(P(A)\)), which could be based on general statistics about the disease.</li> <li>The likelihood (\(P(B \mid A)\)), which is the probability that a person with the disease would test positive on a medical test.</li> <li>The evidence (\(P(B)\)), which is the total probability that anyone, sick or healthy, would test positive.</li> </ul> <p>Bayes’ Rule helps us combine this information to update our belief about the probability of the disease (hypothesis \(A\)) given the test result (evidence \(B\)).</p> <h4 id="why-is-bayes-rule-crucial-in-machine-learning"><strong>Why is Bayes’ Rule Crucial in Machine Learning?</strong></h4> <p>Bayes’ Rule is central to a variety of machine learning models, particularly in probabilistic and Bayesian approaches. Some key applications include:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Naive Bayes’ Classifier</strong>: In supervised learning, the Naive Bayes’ classifier uses Bayes’ Rule to classify data based on conditional probabilities. It assumes independence between features, simplifying the computation of probabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Model Inference and Parameter Estimation</strong>: Bayesian methods in machine learning, like Bayesian neural networks, use Bayes’ Rule to update the distribution of model parameters as new data is observed, instead of relying on point estimates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Decision Theory</strong>: Bayes’ Rule helps in decision-making processes by quantifying the uncertainty associated with different outcomes, especially when there is a probabilistic component to the environment or model.</p> </li> </ol> <h4 id="associated-properties-of-bayes-rule"><strong>Associated Properties of Bayes’ Rule</strong></h4> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Bayes’ Theorem for Multiple Events</strong>: Bayes’ Rule can be extended to more complex situations, such as when dealing with multiple hypotheses or events. This is useful when making predictions over many possible outcomes or when dealing with complex models in machine learning.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Conjugacy</strong>: In some models, certain prior distributions are chosen because they lead to mathematical simplicity when combined with Bayes’ Rule. These priors are called <strong>conjugate priors</strong>. For example, in Gaussian processes, using a conjugate prior for the likelihood of Gaussian data results in a simpler update process.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>The Law of Total Probability</strong>: Bayes’ Rule is closely related to the Law of Total Probability, which decomposes the total probability of an event into a sum of conditional probabilities. This can be useful when considering multiple sources of evidence or when performing integration in complex models.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Bayes’ Rule is an indispensable tool in machine learning for reasoning about uncertainty, updating beliefs with new evidence, and making decisions in the face of incomplete information.</p> <hr> <h3 id="joint-probability-and-independence"><strong>Joint Probability and Independence:</strong></h3> <p>In machine learning, understanding how different events relate to each other is critical. Two key concepts that help us analyze these relationships are <strong>joint probability</strong> and <strong>independence</strong>.</p> <h4 id="what-is-joint-probability"><strong>What is Joint Probability?</strong></h4> <p>Joint probability refers to the probability of two or more events occurring simultaneously. In other words, it is the likelihood that multiple events happen at the same time, and is often represented as \(P(A \cap B)\) for two events \(A\) and \(B\).</p> <p>Mathematically, the joint probability of events \(A\) and \(B\) is defined as:</p> \[P(A \cap B) = P(A \mid B) \cdot P(B) = P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)\] <p>This equation shows that the joint probability of two events \(A\) and \(B\) can be computed by multiplying the conditional probability of one event given the other by the probability of the second event. The reverse relationship also holds true.</p> <p><strong>Now, consider this analogy:</strong></p> <p>Imagine you’re rolling two dice and are interested in the probability that the first die shows a 4 and the second die shows a 6. The joint probability, \(P(\text{Die 1 = 4 and Die 2 = 6})\), is the probability of both events happening at once. Since the dice rolls are independent, we can compute this as the product of the individual probabilities:</p> \[P(\text{Die 1 = 4}) \cdot P(\text{Die 2 = 6})\] <p>This product gives the likelihood that both dice will show these values simultaneously.</p> <h4 id="why-is-joint-probability-important-in-machine-learning"><strong>Why is Joint Probability Important in Machine Learning?</strong></h4> <p>Joint probability is used to model relationships between different features or variables in a dataset. Some applications include:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Multivariate Probability Models</strong>: In many machine learning problems, we are dealing with multiple features simultaneously. Joint probability helps model the dependencies between these features, which is essential for tasks like classification or clustering. For example, in a classification task, joint probabilities allow us to compute the likelihood of a particular outcome given multiple features.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Markov Chains</strong>: In sequence-based tasks like time series forecasting, the joint probability of a sequence of events (e.g., states in a Markov Chain) is crucial in determining the probability distribution over future states based on previous ones.</p> </li> </ol> <h4 id="what-is-independence"><strong>What is Independence?</strong></h4> <p>Two events \(A\) and \(B\) are said to be <strong>independent</strong> if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring. Mathematically, two events are independent if:</p> \[P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)\] <p>This property is a key assumption in many machine learning algorithms, especially those based on probabilistic reasoning.</p> <p><strong>For Intuition, think it this way:</strong></p> <p>Think of tossing a coin and rolling a die. The outcome of the coin toss does not affect the outcome of the die roll. These two events are independent, meaning the joint probability can be computed as the product of their individual probabilities. So, the probability of getting heads on the coin toss and a 6 on the die roll is:</p> \[P(\text{Heads}) \cdot P(\text{Die = 6})\] <h4 id="why-is-independence-important-in-machine-learning"><strong>Why is Independence Important in Machine Learning?</strong></h4> <p>Independence is a simplifying assumption in many machine learning models and can significantly reduce the complexity of computations:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Naive Bayes Classifier</strong>: The Naive Bayes classifier makes a strong independence assumption—that the features are conditionally independent given the class. This simplifies the computation of joint probabilities for multiple features and makes the model efficient even with high-dimensional data.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Factorization</strong>: In probabilistic models, assuming independence allows for factorizing the joint probability distribution into simpler, more manageable parts. This can be particularly useful in situations like generative models or in deep learning when modeling complex dependencies in large datasets.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Feature Independence</strong>: In feature engineering, assuming that features are independent can help simplify model design and speed up training. It’s often used as a heuristic, particularly when exploring models like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) or Hidden Markov Models (HMM).</p> </li> </ol> <h4 id="conditional-independence"><strong>Conditional Independence</strong></h4> <p>While not the same as plain independence, <strong>conditional independence</strong> is another important concept. Two events \(A\) and \(B\) are conditionally independent given a third event \(C\) if:</p> \[P(A \cap B \mid C) = P(A \mid C) \cdot P(B \mid C)\] <p>This property is widely used in Bayesian networks and machine learning models to break down complex dependencies into simpler conditional ones.</p> <hr> <h3 id="conditional-probability-and-conditional-distributions-building-blocks-for-predictive-models"><strong>Conditional Probability and Conditional Distributions: Building Blocks for Predictive Models</strong></h3> <p>Conditional probability and conditional distributions concepts help us refine predictions based on additional information and allow us to build more accurate, data-driven models by considering how the likelihood of one event changes when we know about the occurrence of another.</p> <h4 id="what-is-conditional-probability"><strong>What is Conditional Probability?</strong></h4> <p>Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. In other words, it quantifies the likelihood of an event, assuming that certain information is known. It is expressed as:</p> \[P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>\(P(A \mid B)\) is the <strong>conditional probability</strong> of event \(A\) given event \(B\).</li> <li>\(P(A \cap B)\) is the <strong>joint probability</strong> of both \(A\) and \(B\) occurring.</li> <li>\(P(B)\) is the <strong>probability</strong> of event \(B\).</li> </ul> <p>This formula helps us understand how the occurrence of one event (\(B\)) affects the likelihood of another event (\(A\)).</p> <p><strong>Intuition and Analogy for Conditional Probability</strong></p> <p>Imagine you’re at a concert and you’re interested in the probability that a person will be wearing a red T-shirt, given that they are in the front row. Without any information, the probability of someone wearing a red T-shirt might be 30%. But if you know that the person is in the front row (which could imply a certain type of concertgoer), this could affect the probability—perhaps fans who are in the front row are more likely to wear red.</p> <p>This situation is an example of <strong>conditional probability</strong>, where the event \(A\) (person wearing a red T-shirt) is conditioned on the event \(B\) (person being in the front row). Conditional probability helps refine your predictions based on new information.</p> <h4 id="why-is-conditional-probability-important-in-machine-learning"><strong>Why is Conditional Probability Important in Machine Learning?</strong></h4> <p>Conditional probability is essential in many machine learning models for predicting outcomes based on known data. Key applications include:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Classification and Regression</strong>: In supervised learning, we use conditional probability to predict the class label (in classification) or continuous values (in regression) based on observed features. For instance, in logistic regression, we compute the conditional probability of a binary outcome given certain feature values.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Naive Bayes Classifier</strong>: The Naive Bayes algorithm, which assumes conditional independence of features, uses conditional probabilities to predict class labels. It calculates the probability of the class label given the observed features using Bayes’ Theorem.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bayesian Inference</strong>: In Bayesian methods, we continuously update the probability of a hypothesis based on new data. This is done using conditional probabilities and allows for probabilistic reasoning in models such as Bayesian networks.</p> </li> </ol> <h4 id="what-are-conditional-distributions"><strong>What are Conditional Distributions?</strong></h4> <p>A <strong>conditional distribution</strong> is a probability distribution of a subset of variables given the values of other variables. It generalizes conditional probability to the case of multiple random variables and helps us understand how the distribution of one variable changes when the values of others are known.</p> <p>For example, if you have two variables \(X\) and \(Y\), the conditional distribution of \(X\) given \(Y = y\) is the probability distribution of \(X\) when you know that \(Y\) takes the specific value \(y\).</p> <p>Mathematically, a conditional distribution is denoted as:</p> \[P(X \mid Y = y)\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>\(P(X \mid Y = y)\) is the conditional distribution of \(X\) given that \(Y = y\).</li> <li>This describes how the distribution of \(X\) changes when \(Y\) is fixed at a particular value.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Intuition and Analogy for Conditional Distributions</strong></p> <p>Consider a scenario where you’re trying to predict a person’s income (\(X\)) based on their level of education (\(Y\)). If you know that someone has a college degree, the distribution of their income (the possible range of incomes they could have) will be different than if you only know their high school education level.</p> <p>In this case, \(P(X \mid Y)\) would describe the distribution of income (\(X\)) conditional on a specific level of education (\(Y\)). The distribution will shift depending on the value of \(Y\), helping refine your predictions of income based on known education levels.</p> <h4 id="why-are-conditional-distributions-important-in-machine-learning"><strong>Why are Conditional Distributions Important in Machine Learning?</strong></h4> <p>Conditional distributions are vital in machine learning for understanding relationships between features and predicting outcomes. Some key uses include:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Generative Models</strong>: In models like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) or Hidden Markov Models (HMM), conditional distributions are used to model how data points (such as observations or states) are generated given certain parameters.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Bayesian Networks</strong>: In Bayesian networks, the conditional distributions represent the probabilistic dependencies between variables. Each node (representing a random variable) has a conditional distribution based on its parent nodes, and the overall network structure allows us to compute the joint distribution of all variables.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm</strong>: The EM algorithm, used for unsupervised learning and model fitting, relies on conditional distributions to estimate parameters in models with missing or incomplete data. The E-step computes the conditional distributions of hidden variables given the observed data.</p> </li> </ol> <p>While conditional probability allows us to adjust our expectations based on new information, conditional distributions give us a broader view of how data is distributed when specific conditions are known.</p> <hr> <h3 id="law-of-total-probability-a-fundamental-tool-for-dealing-with-uncertainty"><strong>Law of Total Probability: A Fundamental Tool for Dealing with Uncertainty</strong></h3> <p>The Law of Total Probability is a key principle that allows us to compute the probability of an event by considering all possible ways that event could occur, based on different conditions or scenarios. This law is often used in machine learning when dealing with complex models where outcomes depend on multiple factors, or when some information is missing or unknown.</p> <h4 id="what-is-the-law-of-total-probability"><strong>What is the Law of Total Probability?</strong></h4> <p>It helps us calculate the probability of an event by partitioning the sample space into different mutually exclusive events and then summing up the probabilities of the event occurring in each of these partitions.</p> <p>Mathematically, the law is expressed as:</p> \[P(A) = \sum_{i} P(A \mid B_i) P(B_i)\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>\(P(A)\) is the total probability of event \(A\).</li> <li>\(B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n\) are a partition of the sample space, meaning these events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (they cover all possible outcomes).</li> <li>\(P(A \mid B_i)\) is the <strong>conditional probability</strong> of \(A\) given \(B_i\), i.e., the probability of \(A\) occurring under the condition that \(B_i\) occurs.</li> <li>\(P(B_i)\) is the probability of event \(B_i\).</li> </ul> <p>The law essentially breaks down the probability of \(A\) into cases based on different conditions \(B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n\), and then combines them weighted by the likelihood of each condition.</p> <p><strong>So, how to internalize this idea:</strong></p> <p>Imagine you are trying to determine the probability that a customer will purchase a product \(A\), but you have different types of customers \(B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n\) (e.g., based on their age group, spending history, etc.). The probability that a customer purchases the product will vary depending on their group. The Law of Total Probability tells you to:</p> <ol> <li>Calculate the probability of purchasing given each customer type (e.g., \(P(A \mid B_1)\), \(P(A \mid B_2)\), etc.).</li> <li>Multiply these by the probability of each customer type occurring (e.g., \(P(B_1)\), \(P(B_2)\)).</li> <li>Sum these products to find the total probability of purchasing across all customer types.</li> </ol> <p>In this way, the law allows you to compute the overall probability by considering all relevant scenarios (customer types) and weighing them accordingly.</p> <h4 id="why-is-the-law-of-total-probability-important-in-machine-learning"><strong>Why is the Law of Total Probability Important in Machine Learning?</strong></h4> <p>In machine learning, the Law of Total Probability is widely used for various tasks, especially in probabilistic modeling, classification, and predictive analytics. Some key applications include:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Bayesian Inference</strong>: When updating beliefs about a hypothesis (or class) based on new data, the total probability is calculated over all possible hypotheses or classes. This helps refine predictions and is foundational in models such as <strong>Naive Bayes</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Handling Missing Data</strong>: In models dealing with missing data, the law helps to marginalize over the unknown values by considering all possible ways the data could be missing. For example, in the <strong>Expectation-Maximization (EM)</strong> algorithm, the law is used to estimate the missing values based on the observed data.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Class Conditional Probability in Classification</strong>: In classification problems, especially when working with multiple classes, the law allows the decomposition of class probabilities into conditional probabilities based on different features, facilitating the calculation of total class probabilities.</p> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Example: Applying the Law of Total Probability</strong></p> <p>Let’s consider an example in a classification task. Suppose you are trying to predict whether a customer will buy a product \(A\) (event \(A\)), and you have two features that classify the customer: whether they are a <strong>new customer</strong> (\(B_1\)) or a <strong>returning customer</strong> (\(B_2\)).</p> <p>The Law of Total Probability helps you compute the total probability of purchasing the product, considering both new and returning customers:</p> \[P(\text{Buy}) = P(\text{Buy} \mid \text{New Customer}) \cdot P(\text{New Customer}) + P(\text{Buy} \mid \text{Returning Customer}) \cdot P(\text{Returning Customer})\] <p>Here:</p> <ul> <li>\(P(\text{Buy} \mid \text{New Customer})\) is the probability that a new customer buys the product.</li> <li>\(P(\text{New Customer})\) is the probability that the customer is new.</li> <li>Similarly, \(P(\text{Buy} \mid \text{Returning Customer})\) and \(P(\text{Returning Customer})\) are for the returning customers.</li> </ul> <p>This allows you to compute the total probability of a customer buying the product, considering both customer types.</p> <h4 id="connection-with-conditional-probability"><strong>Connection with Conditional Probability</strong></h4> <p>The Law of Total Probability is built on conditional probability. It helps us to marginalize over unknown or unobserved conditions, ensuring we account for all possible scenarios that could influence the event of interest.</p> <p>For example, in a machine learning model that makes predictions based on different feature values, the law allows us to break down the total probability of an outcome by conditioning on the feature values and summing over all possible feature combinations.</p> <p>Whether you are building a Bayesian model, dealing with missing data, or predicting outcomes in complex scenarios, the Law of Total Probability provides a systematic way to combine multiple probabilities and refine your model’s predictions.</p> <hr> <h3 id="expectation-and-variance-essential-measures"><strong>Expectation and Variance: Essential Measures</strong></h3> <p>They provide valuable insights into the behavior of data and are widely used in machine learning to understand the characteristics of models, assess uncertainty, and make predictions. Here’s a breakdown of each concept and its relevance to machine learning.</p> <h4 id="what-is-expectation"><strong>What is Expectation?</strong></h4> <p>The <strong>expectation</strong> (or <strong>mean</strong>) of a random variable represents its <strong>average</strong> or <strong>central tendency</strong>. It is the weighted average of all possible values that the variable can take, where the weights are given by the probabilities of these values.</p> <p>For a discrete random variable \(X\), the expectation \(E(X)\) is defined as:</p> \[E(X) = \sum_{i} x_i P(x_i)\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>\(x_i\) are the possible values that \(X\) can take.</li> <li>\(P(x_i)\) is the probability of \(X\) taking the value \(x_i\).</li> </ul> <p>For a continuous random variable with probability density function \(f(x)\), the expectation is:</p> \[E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) \, dx\] <p><strong>Intuition for Expectation:</strong></p> <p>Think of expectation as the “balance point” of a distribution. For example, if you were to imagine a physical rod with different weights placed at various points, the <strong>center of mass</strong> of the rod would represent the expectation.</p> <p>In machine learning, the expectation helps us understand the <strong>average behavior</strong> of the data. For instance, in regression tasks, the expectation of the target variable provides a baseline prediction.</p> <h4 id="what-is-variance"><strong>What is Variance?</strong></h4> <p>The <strong>variance</strong> of a random variable quantifies the spread or dispersion of the variable around its expectation. A high variance indicates that the values are widely spread out, while a low variance indicates that the values are clustered around the mean.</p> <p>For a discrete random variable \(X\), the variance \(\text{Var}(X)\) is defined as:</p> \[\text{Var}(X) = E[(X - E(X))^2] = \sum_{i} (x_i - E(X))^2 P(x_i)\] <p>For a continuous random variable:</p> \[\text{Var}(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x - E(X))^2 f(x) \, dx\] <p>Alternatively, variance can also be computed as:</p> \[\text{Var}(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2\] <p>Where \(E(X^2)\) is the expectation of \(X^2\), i.e., the expected value of the square of \(X\).</p> <p><strong>Intuition for Variance:</strong></p> <p>Variance tells us about the <strong>spread</strong> of the data.

A small sample might produce a skewed or non-normal distribution. However, as you increase the sample size, the distribution of the sample mean will become increasingly normal, regardless of the original distribution shape.</p> <p>This phenomenon is like averaging noisy measurements in engineering. A single measurement might be noisy, but averaging multiple measurements reduces the noise, making the result more predictable and normally distributed.</p> <h4 id="why-is-the-central-limit-theorem-important-in-machine-learning"><strong>Why is the Central Limit Theorem Important in Machine Learning?</strong></h4> <p>The Central Limit Theorem is foundational in statistics and machine learning for the following reasons:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Foundation for Inference</strong>: <ul> <li>The CLT enables statistical inference techniques like hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. When drawing random samples, the sample mean will follow a normal distribution, allowing for probabilistic statements about population parameters.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Simplifying Assumptions</strong>: <ul> <li>Many machine learning algorithms assume normality (e.g., linear regression). The CLT allows us to assume that, for sufficiently large datasets, estimators of model parameters will follow a normal distribution, making them easier to analyze.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Sample Size Considerations</strong>: <ul> <li>The CLT shows that, for large datasets, we can assume normality even if the underlying data is non-normal. As the sample size increases, algorithms become more stable and their performance becomes more predictable.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Example of the Central Limit Theorem in Practice</strong></p> <p>Imagine you are analyzing <strong>house prices</strong> in a city, and the distribution of house prices is highly skewed due to a few luxury homes. You want to estimate the average house price.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Without CLT</strong>: The highly skewed data would result in a mean that doesn’t reflect the typical house price.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>With CLT</strong>: By taking random samples, computing the mean for each sample, and repeating the process many times, the distribution of sample means will become normal, even though the underlying distribution of house prices is skewed. The sample mean will be a more reliable estimator of the population mean, allowing for more accurate confidence intervals.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="central-limit-theorem-in-machine-learning"><strong>Central Limit Theorem in Machine Learning</strong></h4> <p>The CLT is useful in several machine learning contexts:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Regression Models</strong>: <ul> <li>In linear regression, the CLT implies that, for large sample sizes, the distribution of estimated coefficients will be approximately normal. This enables the use of confidence intervals to assess uncertainty in the coefficients.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Bootstrap Methods</strong>: <ul> <li>The CLT is essential for bootstrap resampling methods, which estimate the variability of a statistic (like the mean) by repeatedly sampling from the data. Due to the CLT, the distribution of these sample statistics will be approximately normal.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing</strong>: <ul> <li>Many machine learning techniques rely on the CLT to estimate confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing. For example, in regression, the standard error of the coefficients is derived from the CLT.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h4 id="conditions-for-the-central-limit-theorem"><strong>Conditions for the Central Limit Theorem</strong></h4> <p>For the CLT to hold, the following conditions are necessary:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Independence</strong>: The samples must be independent.</li> <li> <strong>Sample Size</strong>: The sample size should be large enough. Typically, a sample size of 30 or more is considered sufficient for the CLT to apply.</li> <li> <strong>Finite Variance</strong>: The population must have a finite variance.</li> </ol> <p>By leveraging the CLT, you can make reliable estimates, perform hypothesis testing, and create models that work well, even when the underlying data distribution is non-normal.</p> <hr> <p>Finally, we’ve explored key concepts in probability theory that are important to machine learning. From understanding the basics of probability distributions and Bayes’ Theorem to the relationships between variables through covariance and correlation, these concepts provide the mathematical layer for building robust models. Finally, the Central Limit Theorem ties everything together, offering insight into statistical inference and ensuring that predictions and model estimates are reliable.</p> <p>In the next post, we’ll continue diving deeper into the brief history of machine learning and what are we upto currently.</p> <p><strong>See you there!</strong></p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Monishver Chandrasekaran.
