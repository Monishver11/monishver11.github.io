While binary classification is a fundamental building block, it’s crucial to understand how we can extend these ideas to handle multiple classes. This transition from binary to multiclass classification is what we’ll explore in this blog. We’ll start by revisiting <strong>binary logistic regression</strong>, then step into <strong>multiclass logistic regression</strong>, and finally discuss how we can generalize algorithms like the perceptron for multiclass classification.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="binary-logistic-regression-recap"><strong>Binary Logistic Regression Recap</strong></h5> <p>Let’s begin with the most basic form of classification: binary logistic regression.</p> <p>Given an input \(x\), our goal is to predict whether it belongs to class 1 or class 0. The function we use for binary classification is called the <strong>sigmoid function</strong>, which outputs a probability between 0 and 1:</p> \[f(x) = \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-z)} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-w^\top x - b)} \quad (1)\] <p>The output \(f(x)\) represents the probability of class 1. The probability of the other class (class 0) is simply:</p> \[1 - f(x) = \frac{\exp(-w^\top x - b)}{1 + \exp(-w^\top x - b)} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(w^\top x + b)} = \sigma(-z) \quad (2)\] <p>Another way to think about this is that one class corresponds to the parameters \(w\) and \(b\), while the other class corresponds to the parameters \(-w\) and \(-b\). This helps set the foundation for extending this concept to multiple classes.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="extending-to-multiclass-logistic-regression"><strong>Extending to Multiclass Logistic Regression</strong></h5> <p>Now that we have a solid understanding of binary logistic regression, let’s consider the case where we have more than two classes. This is where <strong>multiclass logistic regression</strong> comes in. For each class \(c\), we assign a weight vector \(w_c\) and a bias \(b_c\). The probability of belonging to class \(c\) given an input \(x\) is computed using the <strong>softmax function</strong>:</p> \[f_c(x) = \frac{\exp(w_c^\top x + b_c)}{\sum_{c'} \exp(w_{c'}^\top x + b_{c'})} \quad (3)\] <p>This formulation, known as <strong>softmax regression</strong>, allows us to calculate the probability for each class and select the class with the highest probability.</p> <h5 id="the-loss-function"><strong>The Loss Function</strong></h5> <p>To train the model, we use a <strong>cross-entropy loss</strong> function, which measures how well the model’s predicted probabilities match the true labels. Given a dataset \(\{(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\}\), the loss is defined as:</p> \[L = \sum_i -\log f_{y^{(i)}}(x^{(i)})\] <p>This loss function encourages the model to assign higher probabilities to the correct class. The gradient of the loss with respect to the pre-activation (logits) is:</p> \[\frac{\partial L}{\partial z} = f - y\] <p><strong>Derivation:</strong></p> <p>Assume the true class is \(k = y^{(i)}\). The loss for this example is:</p> \[\ell^{(i)} = -\log f_k^{(i)}\] <p>Substituting in the softmax definition:</p> \[\ell^{(i)} = -\log\left( \frac{\exp(z_k^{(i)})}{\sum_{j=1}^C \exp(z_j^{(i)})} \right) = -z_k^{(i)} + \log \left( \sum_{j=1}^C \exp(z_j^{(i)}) \right)\] <p>We differentiate the loss \(\ell^{(i)}\) with respect to each logit \(z_c^{(i)}\). There are two cases:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Case 1: \(c = k\) (the correct class)</strong></li> </ul> \[\frac{\partial \ell^{(i)}}{\partial z_k^{(i)}} = -1 + \frac{\exp(z_k^{(i)})}{\sum_{j=1}^C \exp(z_j^{(i)})} = f_k^{(i)} - 1\] <ul> <li><strong>Case 2: \(c \ne k\)</strong></li> </ul> \[\frac{\partial \ell^{(i)}}{\partial z_c^{(i)}} = \frac{\exp(z_c^{(i)})}{\sum_{j=1}^C \exp(z_j^{(i)})} = f_c^{(i)}\] <p>We can express both cases together using the one-hot encoded label vector \(y^{(i)}\):</p> \[\frac{\partial \ell^{(i)}}{\partial z^{(i)}} = f^{(i)} - y^{(i)}\] <p>Now, let \(f\) and \(y\) now represent the matrices of predicted probabilities and one-hot labels over the entire dataset. Then the total loss is:</p> \[L = \sum_{i=1}^N \ell^{(i)} = -\sum_{i=1}^N \log f_{y^{(i)}}^{(i)}\] <p>By stacking all gradients, the overall gradient of the loss with respect to the logits becomes:</p> \[\frac{\partial L}{\partial z} = f - y\] <p>This fully vectorized form allows efficient implementation and is similar to the gradient descent update used in binary logistic regression but generalized to multiple classes.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="quick-comparison-to-one-vs-all-ova-approach"><strong>Quick Comparison to One-vs-All (OvA) Approach</strong></h5> <p>In many multiclass problems, instead of learning a separate model for each class, we can use the <strong>One-vs-All (OvA)</strong> strategy. In OvA, we train a binary classifier for each class, where the classifier tries to distinguish one class from all others. The base hypothesis space in this case is:</p> \[\mathcal{H} = \{ h: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R} \} \quad \text{(score functions)}\] <p>For \(k\) classes, the <strong>multiclass hypothesis space</strong> is:</p> \[\mathcal{F} = \left\{ x \mapsto \arg\max_i h_i(x) \ \big| \ h_1, \ldots, h_k \in \mathcal{H} \right\}\] <p>Intuitively, each function \(h_i(x)\) scores how likely \(x\) belongs to class \(i\). During training, we want each classifier to output positive values for examples from its own class and negative values for examples from all other classes. At test time, the classifier that outputs the highest score determines the predicted class.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="multiclass-perceptron-generalizing-the-perceptron-algorithm"><strong>Multiclass Perceptron: Generalizing the Perceptron Algorithm</strong></h5> <p>The classic Perceptron algorithm is designed for binary classification, but it can be naturally extended to multiclass problems. In the multiclass setting, instead of a single weight vector, we maintain <strong>one weight vector per class</strong>.</p> <p>For each class \(i\), we define a <strong>linear scoring function</strong>:</p> \[h_i(x) = w_i^\top x, \quad w_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\] <p>Given an input \(x\), the model predicts the class with the highest score:</p> \[\hat{y} = \arg\max_{i} w_i^\top x\] <p>The algorithm proceeds iteratively, updating the weights when it makes a mistake:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Initialize</strong>: Set all weight vectors to zero, \(w_i = 0\) for all classes $i$.</li> <li>For \(T\) iterations over the training set: <ul> <li>For each training example \((x, y)\): <ul> <li>Predict the label: \(\hat{y} = \arg\max_{i} w_i^\top x\)</li> <li>If \(\hat{y} \neq y\) (i.e., the prediction is incorrect): <ul> <li><strong>Promote</strong> the correct class:<br/> \(w_y \leftarrow w_y + x\)</li> <li><strong>Demote</strong> the incorrect prediction: \(w_{\hat{y}} \leftarrow w_{\hat{y}} - x\)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>This update increases the score for the true class and decreases the score for the incorrect one, helping the model learn to separate them better in future iterations.</p> <h5 id="rewrite-the-scoring-function"><strong>Rewrite the scoring function</strong></h5> <p>When the number of classes \(k\) is large, storing and updating \(k\) separate weight vectors can become computationally expensive. To address this, we can rewrite the scoring function in a more compact form using a <strong>shared weight vector</strong>.</p> <p>We define a <strong>joint feature map</strong> \(\psi(x, i)\) that combines both the input \(x\) and a class label \(i\). Then, the score for class \(i\) can be written as:</p> \[h_i(x) = w_i^\top x = w^\top \psi(x, i) \tag{4}\] <p>Now, instead of maintaining a separate \(w_i\) for each class, we use <strong>a single global weight vector</strong> \(w\) that interacts with \(\psi(x, i)\) to compute scores for all classes:</p> \[h(x, i) = w^\top \psi(x, i) \tag{5}\] <p>This transformation allows us to use a single weight vector for all classes, which significantly reduces memory usage and computational complexity.</p> <p><strong>Concrete Example</strong></p> <p>Let:</p> <ul> <li>Input vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^2\), e.g.,</li> </ul> \[x = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}\] <ul> <li>Number of classes \(k = 3\)</li> </ul> <p>We define \(\psi(x, i)\) as a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^{2k}\) (i.e., 6 dimensions). It places \(x\) into the block corresponding to class \(i\) and zeros elsewhere.</p> <p>For example, for class \(i = 2\):</p> \[\psi(x, 2) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \end{bmatrix}\] <p>Let \(w \in \mathbb{R}^6\) (since \(x \in \mathbb{R}^2\) and \(k = 3\)):</p> \[w = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ -1.0 \\ 0.2 \\ 0.3 \\ -0.4 \\ 1.0 \\ \end{bmatrix}\] <p>To compute the score for class 2:</p> \[h(x, 2) = w^\top \psi(x, 2)\] <p>Only the block for class 2 is active:</p> \[h(x, 2) = [0.2, 0.3]^\top \cdot [1, 2] = 0.2 \cdot 1 + 0.3 \cdot 2 = 0.8\] <p>We can now compute scores for all classes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Class 1 uses block: \([0.5, -1.0]\)</p> \[h(x, 1) = 0.5 \cdot 1 + (-1.0) \cdot 2 = -1.5\] </li> <li> <p>Class 2: (already computed) \(0.8\)</p> </li> <li> <p>Class 3 uses block: \([-0.4, 1.0]\)</p> \[h(x, 3) = -0.4 \cdot 1 + 1.0 \cdot 2 = 1.6\] </li> </ul> <p>For final prediction, we select the class with the highest score:</p> \[\hat{y} = \arg\max_i h(x, i) = 3\] <p>So, for input \(x = [1, 2]\), the predicted class is <strong>3</strong>.</p> <p>And suppose the true label is:</p> \[y = 2\] <p>Since \(\hat{y} \ne y\), the prediction is incorrect.</p> <p>The classic multiclass Perceptron updates:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Promote</strong> the correct class (add input to the correct class block)</li> <li><strong>Demote</strong> the predicted class (subtract input from the predicted class block)</li> </ul> <p>Using the joint feature map:</p> \[w \leftarrow w + \psi(x, y) - \psi(x, \hat{y})\] <p>In our case:</p> <ul> <li> \[\psi(x, y) = \psi(x, 2) = [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0]^\top\] </li> <li> \[\psi(x, \hat{y}) = \psi(x, 3) = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2]^\top\] </li> </ul> <p>Then:</p> \[w_{\text{new}} = w + \psi(x, 2) - \psi(x, 3)\] <p>Apply this update:</p> \[w = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ -1.0 \\ 0.2 \\ 0.3 \\ -0.4 \\ 1.0 \\ \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ -1.0 \\ 1.2 \\ 2.3 \\ -1.4 \\ -1.0 \\ \end{bmatrix}\] <p>This update increases the score for the correct class (2) and decreases the score for the incorrect prediction (3), just like the original multiclass Perceptron but using a single shared weight vector and structured feature representation.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="formalising-via-multivector-construction"><strong>Formalising via Multivector Construction</strong></h5> <p>Consider a simple example where \(x \in \mathbb{R}^2\) and we have 3 classes \(Y = \{1, 2, 3\}\). Suppose we stack the weight vectors for each class together in the following way:</p> \[w = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, 0, 1, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \end{pmatrix}^\top\] <p>Now, define the feature map \(\Psi(x, y)\) as follows:</p> <ul> <li> \[\Psi(x, 1) = (x_1, x_2, 0, 0, 0, 0)\] </li> <li> \[\Psi(x, 2) = (0, 0, x_1, x_2, 0, 0)\] </li> <li> \[\Psi(x, 3) = (0, 0, 0, 0, x_1, x_2)\] </li> </ul> <p>The dot product between the weight vector \(w\) and the feature map \(\Psi(x, y)\) is then:</p> \[\langle w, \Psi(x, y) \rangle = \langle w_y, x \rangle\] <p>This approach allows us to represent all classes using a single weight vector, which is more efficient and scalable.</p> <p>With the multivector construction in place, the multiclass perceptron algorithm can be rewritten as follows:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Initialize</strong> the weight vector \(w = 0\).</li> <li>For \(T\) iterations, repeat the following for each training example \((x, y)\): <ul> <li>Predict \(\hat{y} = \arg\max_{y'} w^\top \psi(x, y')\) (choose the class with the highest score).</li> <li>If \(\hat{y} \neq y\): <ul> <li>Update the weight vector: \(w \leftarrow w + \psi(x, y)\).</li> <li>Update the weight vector: \(w \leftarrow w - \psi(x, \hat{y})\).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>This version of the algorithm is computationally efficient and scales well to large datasets.</p> <p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the <strong>base binary classification problem</strong> in multiclass perceptron?</p> <p><strong>Answer</strong>: At each update step, the multiclass Perceptron reduces to a binary classification problem between the correct class \(y\) and the predicted class \(\hat{y}\). The model must adjust the weights so that \(y\) scores higher than \(\hat{y}\) — just like in a binary classification setting where one class must be separated from another.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="feature-engineering-for-multiclass-tasks"><strong>Feature Engineering for Multiclass Tasks</strong></h5> <p>To apply the multivector construction in practice, we need to define meaningful and informative features that capture the relationship between the input and each possible class. This is especially important in structured prediction tasks like <strong>part-of-speech (POS) tagging</strong>.</p> <p>Suppose our input space \(X\) consists of all possible words, and our label space \(Y\) contains the categories {NOUN, VERB, ADJECTIVE, ADVERB, etc.}. Each input word needs to be classified into one of these grammatical categories.</p> <p>We can define features that depend on both the input word and the target label — a natural fit for the joint feature map \(\Psi(x, y)\) introduced earlier. For example, some useful features might include:</p> <ul> <li>Whether the word is exactly a specific token (e.g., “run”, “apple”)</li> <li>Whether the word ends in certain suffixes (e.g., “ly” for adverbs)</li> <li>Capitalization or presence of digits (in named entity recognition)</li> </ul> <p>Here are a few sample features written in the multivector style:</p> <ul> <li> \[\psi_1(x, y) = 1[x = \text{apple} \land y = \text{NOUN}]\] </li> <li> \[\psi_2(x, y) = 1[x = \text{run} \land y = \text{NOUN}]\] </li> <li> \[\psi_3(x, y) = 1[x = \text{run} \land y = \text{VERB}]\] </li> <li> \[\psi_4(x, y) = 1[x \text{ ends in } \text{ly} \land y = \text{ADVERB}]\] </li> </ul> <p>Each of these features “activates” only when both the input word and the predicted class match a certain pattern. This is perfectly aligned with the multivector framework, where the model learns weights for specific combinations of features and labels.</p> <h5 id="feature-templates"><strong>Feature Templates</strong></h5> <p>In real-world applications, especially in natural language processing (NLP), we rarely hand-code features for every word. Instead, we use <strong>feature templates</strong> that automatically generate features from observed patterns.</p> <p><strong>What is a Feature Template?</strong></p> <p>A feature template is a <strong>rule or function</strong> that, given an input and a label, produces one or more binary features of the form \(\psi(x, y)\).</p> <p>Templates help create thousands or even millions of features in a structured and consistent way.</p> <p>Let’s say we want to predict the POS tag for the word <strong>“running”</strong> in the sentence:</p> <blockquote> <p>I am <strong>running</strong> late.</p> </blockquote> <p>We might use the following templates:</p> <hr/> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Template Description</th> <th>Template Rule</th> <th>Example Feature</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Current word</td> <td>\(\psi(x, y) = 1[x = w \land y = y']\)</td> <td>\(x = \text{"running"}, y = \text{VERB}\)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Word suffix (3 chars)</td> <td>\(\psi(x, y) = 1[x[-3:] = s \land y = y']\)</td> <td>\(x[-3:] = \text{"ing"}, y = \text{VERB}\)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Previous word is “am”</td> <td>\(\psi(x, y) = 1[\text{prev}(x) = \text{"am"} \land y = y']\)</td> <td>\(y = \text{VERB}\)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Is capitalized</td> <td>\(\psi(x, y) = 1[x[0].\text{isupper()} \land y = y']\)</td> <td>—</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Prefix (first 2 letters)</td> <td>\(\psi(x, y) = 1[x[:2] = p \land y = y']\)</td> <td>\(x[:2] = \text{"ru"}, y = \text{VERB}\)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <hr/> <p>Each of these templates would produce many feature instances across a dataset — and each instance activates only when the corresponding condition holds.</p> <p><strong>Integration with the Model</strong></p> <p>In the multivector model, we don’t store a giant feature matrix explicitly. Instead, we treat each <strong>feature-label pair</strong> \(\psi(x, y)\) as a key that can be mapped to an <strong>index</strong> in a long feature vector. This is done using either:</p> <ul> <li>A <strong>dictionary lookup</strong>, if we predefine all feature-label pairs, or</li> <li>A <strong>hash function</strong>, if we want to compute the index on the fly (common in online or large-scale settings)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Why is this needed?</strong></p> <p>When \(\psi(x, y)\) is represented as a very large sparse vector (e.g. size 100,000+), we don’t want to store all zeros. So instead, we store only the <strong>nonzero features</strong> — each one identified by its <strong>feature name and associated label</strong>.</p> <p>Say we define a feature template:</p> <ul> <li>“Does the word end with ‘ing’?”</li> </ul> <p>Then for the input word <strong>“running”</strong>, and possible labels:</p> <ul> <li> \[\psi(x = \text{running}, y = \text{VERB}) = 1[\text{suffix} = ing \land y = \text{VERB}]\] </li> <li> \[\psi(x = \text{running}, y = \text{NOUN}) = 1[\text{suffix} = ing \land y = \text{NOUN}]\] </li> </ul> <p>These are <strong>two different features</strong>, because they are tied to different labels.</p> <p>We can assign an index to each:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature Name</th> <th>Label</th> <th>Combined Key</th> <th>Index</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suffix=ing</code></td> <td>VERB</td> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suffix=ing_VERB</code></td> <td>1921</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suffix=ing</code></td> <td>NOUN</td> <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">suffix=ing_NOUN</code></td> <td>2390</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>So \(\psi(x, y)\) is implemented as:</p> <ul> <li>A vector of size (say) 50,000,</li> <li>With a single non-zero at position 1921 or 2390, depending on the label,</li> <li>And the model’s weight vector \(w\) has learned weights at those positions.</li> <li> <p>During prediction, we compute:</p> \[\hat{y} = \arg\max_{y'} w^\top \psi(x, y')\] </li> </ul> <p>This is how the model can <strong>distinguish between “ing” being a verb signal vs a noun signal</strong>, just by associating label-specific versions of the feature. And this feature-to-index mapping is what makes it possible to use linear classifiers with sparse high-dimensional features efficiently.</p> <p><strong>So, Why Feature Templates Matter?</strong></p> <ul> <li>They <strong>automate</strong> feature construction and ensure consistency across training and test data.</li> <li>They <strong>generalize well</strong> — e.g., instead of memorizing that “running” is a verb, a suffix-based feature can generalize that any word ending in “ing” is likely a verb.</li> <li>They are <strong>language-agnostic</strong> to some extent — and can be extended to other structured tasks like NER, chunking, or even machine translation.</li> </ul> <p>This feature-based view, combined with the multivector construction, gives us a powerful and scalable way to build multiclass classifiers, especially in domains like NLP where feature engineering plays a key role.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5> <p>We covered how multiclass classification can be tackled using multiclass loss and perceptron algorithms. We highlighted the importance of feature engineering, specifically through feature templates, which help automatically create relevant features for each class. This approach enables efficient, scalable models, especially in tasks like POS tagging. By mapping feature-label pairs to indices, we can handle large datasets without excessive memory usage.</p> <p>Having seen how to generalize the perceptron algorithm, we’ll now move on to explore how <strong>Support Vector Machines (SVMs)</strong> can be extended to handle multiclass classification.

For instance, sentiment analysis classifies text as either <strong>positive or negative</strong>, while spam filters differentiate between <strong>spam and non-spam</strong> emails.</p> <p>However, real-world problems often involve more than two categories, making binary classification insufficient. <strong>Document classification</strong> may require labeling articles into over <strong>ten</strong> categories, <strong>object recognition</strong> must identify objects among <strong>thousands of classes</strong>, and <strong>face recognition</strong> must distinguish between <strong>millions</strong> of individuals.</p> <p>As the number of classes grows, several challenges arise. <strong>Computation cost</strong> increases significantly, especially when training separate models for each class. Additionally, some classes might have far fewer examples than others, leading to <strong>class imbalance</strong> issues. Finally, in some cases, <strong>different types of errors</strong> have varying consequences—for example, misidentifying a handwritten “3” as an “8” might be less problematic than confusing a stop sign with a yield sign in an autonomous driving system.</p> <p>Given these challenges, we need effective strategies to extend binary classification techniques to handle multiple classes efficiently.</p> <hr/> <h4 id="reducing-multiclass-to-binary-classification"><strong>Reducing Multiclass to Binary Classification</strong></h4> <p>A natural way to approach multiclass classification is by reducing it to <strong>multiple binary classification problems</strong>. One naive approach is to represent each class using a unique binary code and train a classifier to predict the code (000, 001, 010). Another approach is to apply <strong>regression</strong>, where each class is assigned a numerical value (1.0, 2.0, 3.0), and the model predicts a continuous number that is rounded to the nearest class.

Suppose we have a <strong>prior distribution</strong> over the weights:</p> \[w \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma_0)\] <p>where \(\Sigma_0\) represents the prior covariance matrix, encoding our initial uncertainty about \(w\). Given an <strong>observed dataset</strong> \(D = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}\), we assume the following <strong>likelihood model</strong>:</p> \[y_i \mid x_i, w \sim \mathcal{N}(w^T x_i, \sigma^2)\] <p>where:</p> <ul> <li>\(X\) is the <strong>design matrix</strong>, consisting of all input feature vectors \(x_i\),</li> <li>\(y\) is the <strong>response column vector</strong>, representing the observed outputs,</li> <li>\(\sigma^2\) represents the <strong>variance of the noise</strong> in the observations.</li> </ul> <p>Using <strong>Bayes’ theorem</strong>, we update our belief about \(w\) after observing data \(D\), leading to a <strong>Gaussian posterior distribution</strong>:</p> \[w \mid D \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_P, \Sigma_P)\] <p>where the posterior mean \(\mu_P\) and covariance \(\Sigma_P\) are given by:</p> \[\mu_P = \left( X^T X + \sigma^2 \Sigma_0^{-1} \right)^{-1} X^T y\] \[\Sigma_P = \left( \sigma^{-2} X^T X + \Sigma_0^{-1} \right)^{-1}\] <p>The posterior mean \(\mu_P\) provides the <strong>best estimate</strong> of \(w\) given the data, while the posterior covariance \(\Sigma_P\) captures the <strong>uncertainty</strong> in our estimation.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="maximum-a-posteriori-map-estimation-and-its-connection-to-ridge-regression"><strong>Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Estimation and Its Connection to Ridge Regression</strong></h5> <p>While the posterior distribution fully describes the uncertainty in \(w\), in practice, we often seek a <strong>point estimate</strong>. The <strong>MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) estimate</strong> of \(w\) is simply the <strong>posterior mean</strong>:</p> \[\hat{w} = \mu_P = \left( X^T X + \sigma^2 \Sigma_0^{-1} \right)^{-1} X^T y\] <p>Now, let’s assume an <strong>isotropic prior</strong> variance:</p> \[\Sigma_0 = \frac{\sigma^2}{\lambda} I\] <p>Plugging this into the MAP estimate simplifies it to:</p> \[\hat{w} = \left( X^T X + \lambda I \right)^{-1} X^T y\] <p>which is precisely the <strong>ridge regression solution</strong>.</p> <p>Thus, ridge regression can be interpreted as a <strong>Bayesian approach</strong> where we assume a Gaussian prior on the weights with variance controlled by \(\lambda\). The larger \(\lambda\), the stronger our prior belief that \(w\) should remain small, leading to <strong>regularization</strong>.</p> <p>This is because the isotropic Gaussian prior on \(w\) has variance \(\frac{\sigma^2}{\lambda}\). As \(\lambda\) increases, the prior variance decreases, implying a stronger belief that the weights \(w\) are closer to zero (more regularization). This results in a simpler model with smaller coefficients, reducing overfitting by penalizing large weights.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="understanding-the-posterior-density-and-ridge-regression"><strong>Understanding the Posterior Density and Ridge Regression</strong></h5> <p>To further illustrate the connection between MAP estimation and ridge regression, let’s look at the <strong>posterior density</strong> of \(w\) under the prior assumption \(\Sigma_0 = \frac{\sigma^2}{\lambda} I\):</p> \[p(w \mid D) \propto \underbrace{\exp \left( - \frac{\lambda}{2 \sigma^2} \|w\|^2 \right)}_{\text{Prior}} \underbrace{\prod_{i=1}^{n} \exp \left( - \frac{(y_i - w^T x_i)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right)}_{\text{Likelihood}}\] <p>To find the <strong>MAP estimate</strong>, we minimize the <strong>negative log-posterior</strong>:</p> \[\hat{w}_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d} \left[ -\log p(w \mid D) \right]\] \[\hat{w}_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d} \left[ \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - w^T x_i)^2}_{\text{Log Likelihood}} + \underbrace{\lambda \|w\|^2}_{\text{Log Prior}} \right]\] <p>This objective function is exactly the <strong>ridge regression loss function</strong>, which balances the <strong>data likelihood</strong> (sum of squared errors) with a <strong>penalty on the weight magnitude</strong>.</p> <p>Thus, we see that <strong>MAP estimation in Bayesian regression is equivalent to ridge regression in frequentist statistics</strong>.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="predictive-posterior-distribution-and-uncertainty-quantification"><strong>Predictive Posterior Distribution and Uncertainty Quantification</strong></h5> <p>Now that we have obtained the posterior distribution of \(w\), we can compute the <strong>predictive distribution</strong> for a <strong>new input point</strong> \(x_{\text{new}}\). Instead of providing just a single point estimate, Bayesian regression gives a <strong>distribution over predictions</strong>, reflecting our confidence.</p> <p>The predictive distribution is given by:</p> \[p(y_{\text{new}} \mid x_{\text{new}}, D) = \int p(y_{\text{new}} \mid x_{\text{new}}, w) p(w \mid D) dw\] <p>Averages over prediction for each \(w\), weighted by posterior distribution.</p> <hr/> <p>The equation represents the <strong>predictive distribution</strong> for a new observation \(y_{\text{new}}\) given a new input \(x_{\text{new}}\) and the data \(D\).</p> <p>It combines:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Likelihood</strong> \(p(y_{\text{new}} \mid x_{\text{new}}, w)\): This term describes how likely the new output \(y_{\text{new}}\) is for a given set of model weights \(w\) and the new input \(x_{\text{new}}\).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Posterior</strong> \(p(w \mid D)\): This is the distribution of the model weights \(w\) after observing the data \(D\), representing the uncertainty in the weights.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The integral averages the likelihood of the new observation over all possible values of the model parameters \(w\), weighted by the posterior distribution \(p(w \mid D)\), because we don’t know the exact value of \(w\) — it can vary based on the data \(D\).</p> <p>Here’s why this happens:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Uncertainty in the weights</strong>: In Bayesian regression, we have uncertainty about the model parameters (weights) \(w\), and the posterior distribution \(p(w \mid D)\) reflects our belief about the possible values of \(w\), given the observed data \(D\).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Prediction is uncertain</strong>: For a new input \(x_{\text{new}}\), the prediction \(y_{\text{new}}\) depends on the model parameters \(w\), and since we have uncertainty in \(w\), we can’t give a single prediction. Instead, we need to compute the distribution over all possible values of \(y_{\text{new}}\) corresponding to all possible values of \(w\).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Integrating over the posterior</strong>: The integral averages over all possible values of \(w\) because we want to account for the uncertainty in \(w\), which is captured by the posterior distribution \(p(w \mid D)\). Each value of \(w\) contributes to the prediction \(y_{\text{new}}\) according to its likelihood, and the posterior distribution tells us how probable each \(w\) is. By integrating, we are essentially weighing each possible prediction by how likely the corresponding weight \(w\) is under the posterior distribution.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Thus, the integral provides the <strong>expected prediction</strong> by combining the likelihood of the new data with the uncertainty about the model parameters. This results in a distribution for the prediction, reflecting both the model’s uncertainty and the uncertainty in the new data.</p> <hr/> <p>Since both the likelihood and posterior are Gaussian, the predictive distribution is also Gaussian:</p> \[y_{\text{new}} \mid x_{\text{new}}, D \sim \mathcal{N} (\eta_{\text{new}}, \sigma_{\text{new}}^2)\] <p>where:</p> \[\eta_{\text{new}} = \mu_P^T x_{\text{new}}\] \[\sigma_{\text{new}}^2 = x_{\text{new}}^T \Sigma_P x_{\text{new}} + \sigma^2\] <p>The predictive variance \(\sigma_{\text{new}}^2\) consists of two terms:</p> <ol> <li>\(x_{\text{new}}^T \Sigma_P x_{\text{new}}\) – <strong>Uncertainty due to finite data</strong>, representing how much we should trust our estimate of \(w\) (or simply uncertainty from the variance of \(w\)).</li> <li>\(\sigma^2\) – <strong>Inherent observation noise</strong>, representing the irreducible error in predicting \(y\).</li> </ol> <p>This decomposition highlights how <strong>Bayesian regression naturally incorporates uncertainty in predictions</strong>.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="why-bayesian-regression-is-powerful"><strong>Why Bayesian Regression is Powerful</strong></h5> <p>One major advantage of Bayesian regression over traditional point estimation methods is that it <strong>provides uncertainty estimates</strong>.

Unlike traditional supervised learning, where a model is trained on a fixed dataset, online learning involves continuously adapting based on feedback from past decisions. One of the simplest and most natural strategies in this setting is <strong>Follow the Leader (FL)</strong>—a method that always picks the action that has performed best in hindsight.</p> <p>While FL is intuitive, it has critical weaknesses that make it unreliable in adversarial settings. To address these limitations, a more robust strategy called <strong>Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL)</strong> was introduced, which introduces randomness to stabilize decision-making. In this post, we will explore the core ideas behind FL and FPL, develop their mathematical formulations, and derive their performance bounds.</p> <h5 id="learning-from-structure-decomposing-losses"><strong>Learning from Structure: Decomposing Losses</strong></h5> <p>Many learning problems can be framed in terms of minimizing cumulative loss, which often decomposes naturally across substructures. For instance, in structured prediction tasks, the total loss may be expressed as a sum over smaller components such as:</p> <ul> <li>The sum of losses along edges in a tree.</li> <li>The sum of losses along a specific path in a graph.</li> <li>The sum of individual substructure losses in a discrete optimization problem.</li> <li>The cumulative loss incurred in an expert setting, where multiple strategies are available, and the goal is to learn from the best-performing one.</li> </ul> <p>This decomposition plays a key role in designing online learning algorithms, as it allows us to analyze decision-making strategies in a structured manner.</p> <h4 id="the-follow-the-leader-fl-strategy"><strong>The Follow the Leader (FL) Strategy</strong></h4> <p>To formalize the <strong>Follow the Leader</strong> approach, let’s consider a general linear decision problem. At each round \(t\), a player selects a decision \(w_t\) from a set \(W\). Once the decision is made, the environment reveals a loss vector \(x_t\), and the player incurs a loss given by the inner product:</p> \[L_t = w_t \cdot x_t\] <p>The objective is to minimize the cumulative loss over \(T\) rounds:</p> \[L_T = \sum_{t=1}^{T} w_t \cdot x_t\] <p>Alternatively, we can evaluate performance through <strong>regret</strong>, which measures how much worse our strategy is compared to the best fixed action in hindsight:</p> \[\text{Regret}_T = L_T - \min_{w \in W} \sum_{t=1}^{T} w \cdot x_t\] <p>The <strong>Follow the Leader</strong> strategy takes a straightforward approach: at each step, it selects the action that has performed best so far. Mathematically, this means choosing:</p> \[w_t = \arg\min_{w \in W} \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} w \cdot x_s\] <p>This approach, sometimes referred to as <strong>fictitious play</strong>, seems reasonable—after all, picking the historically best-performing action should be a good idea, right? However, FL has a major flaw: it can be <strong>highly unstable</strong>. In adversarial settings, small changes in past losses can cause large shifts in decisions, leading to poor performance.</p> <p>To illustrate this, consider a simple scenario where we alternate between two actions. If FL starts with an initial action and then alternates between two different ones, it can end up incurring a loss of 1 at every round, whereas a fixed expert strategy would accumulate much less loss. This instability calls for a more robust alternative.</p> <h4 id="follow-the-perturbed-leader-fpl-adding-randomization"><strong>Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL): Adding Randomization</strong></h4> <p>A simple yet effective modification to FL is <strong>Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL)</strong>. The idea is to <strong>introduce random noise</strong> before selecting the best action, preventing the algorithm from making overly rigid choices based on past data.</p> <p>Instead of selecting the exact leader, FPL picks an action by solving:</p> \[w_t = \arg\min_{w \in W} \left( \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} w \cdot x_s + w \cdot p_t \right)\] <p>where \(p_t\) is a random perturbation added to the cumulative loss. This small tweak dramatically improves performance in adversarial settings by preventing sudden shifts in decisions.</p> <p>A common choice for the perturbation is uniform noise:</p> \[p_t \sim U([0, 1/\epsilon]^N)\] <p>which ensures that no two actions have exactly the same cumulative loss, effectively breaking ties in a randomized manner. Another approach is to use <strong>multiplicative perturbations</strong>, where the noise follows a Laplacian distribution:</p> \[f(x) = \frac{\epsilon}{2} e^{-\epsilon \|x\|_1}\] <p>This version, referred to as <strong>FPL</strong>*, has even stronger guarantees and is particularly effective in adversarial settings. The theoretical analysis of FPL dates back to <strong>Hannan (1957)</strong> and was later refined by <strong>Kalai &amp; Vempala (2004)</strong>.</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>Follow-Up Questions!</p> </blockquote> <h5 id="is-fpl-an-online-learning-strategy-similar-to-the-randomized-weighted-majority-algorithm-rwma-or-is-it-something-else-designed-for-specific-cases"><strong>Is FPL an online learning strategy similar to the Randomized Weighted Majority Algorithm (RWMA), or is it something else designed for specific cases?</strong></h5> <p>Yes, Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL) is an online learning strategy, and it shares some similarities with the Randomized Weighted Majority Algorithm (RWMA) in that both incorporate randomness to improve decision-making and achieve better regret bounds. However, their underlying mechanisms differ.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>RWMA (Randomized Weighted Majority Algorithm)</strong>:<br/> This is an expert-based algorithm where the learner maintains a set of expert weights, updating them multiplicatively based on incurred losses. RWMA is particularly effective in adversarial settings and can be viewed as a special case of Exponentiated Gradient (EG) methods. Its main idea is to give more weight to the experts who perform well, based on past performance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>FPL (Follow the Perturbed Leader)</strong>:<br/> FPL, on the other hand, introduces random perturbations to the past loss values before selecting the best action. This process smooths decision-making, avoiding the instability seen in Follow the Leader (FL) while keeping the simplicity of choosing the best historical action.</p> </li> </ul> <p>FPL is especially useful when working with linear loss functions and structured decision spaces, such as combinatorial optimization problems (e.g., shortest paths, spanning trees). It is closely related to mirror descent and regularization-based algorithms and, in some cases, can be viewed as an implicit form of regularization via perturbations.</p> <p><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>RWMA</strong> is expert-based, where weights are adjusted multiplicatively based on performance.</li> <li><strong>FPL</strong> uses random perturbations to past losses, making it more general and suitable for structured decision-making problems, particularly in combinatorial settings.</li> </ul> <p>In summary, while both algorithms use randomness to stabilize learning, RWMA is more tailored to expert settings, while FPL is a broader decision-making framework effective for combinatorial and structured problems.</p> <h5 id="what-do-we-mean-by-structured-problems"><strong>What Do We Mean by Structured Problems?</strong></h5> <p>A <strong>structured problem</strong> refers to a decision-making setting where the available choices or actions have an underlying structure, often governed by combinatorial, geometric, or graph-based constraints. Instead of choosing from a simple finite set of actions (like in a standard multi-armed bandit or expert setting), the learner must select complex objects such as:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Paths in a graph</strong> (e.g., shortest path routing)</li> <li><strong>Spanning trees</strong> (e.g., network design)</li> <li><strong>Matchings in a bipartite graph</strong> (e.g., job allocation)</li> <li><strong>Binary vectors with constraints</strong> (e.g., feature selection)</li> <li><strong>Matrices or sequences</strong> (e.g., scheduling problems)</li> </ul> <p>In these cases, the decision space is often exponentially large, making direct enumeration or simple expert-based approaches infeasible.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="why-does-flfpl-apply-to-structured-problems"><strong>Why Does FL/FPL Apply to Structured Problems?</strong></h5> <p>The <strong>Follow the Leader (FL)</strong> and <strong>Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL)</strong> strategies naturally extend to structured problems because:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Linear Loss Structure</strong>: Many structured problems can be formulated in terms of a linear loss function over the structure. For example, if selecting a path in a graph, the total loss might be the sum of edge losses along the path. FL/FPL directly works with such additive losses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Combinatorial Decision Spaces</strong>: Since the space of possible decisions is structured (e.g., spanning trees, paths), explicitly maintaining weights over all choices, as in the Weighted Majority Algorithm, is impractical. Instead, FL/FPL selects actions by solving an optimization problem over the structured space.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Computational Feasibility</strong>: The FL and FPL updates involve solving an argmin optimization problem over past losses:</p> </li> </ol> \[w_t = \arg \min_{w \in W} \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} w \cdot x_s\] <p>This optimization often reduces to a well-known combinatorial problem, such as minimum spanning tree, shortest path, or maximum matching, which can be solved efficiently using algorithms from combinatorial optimization.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="how-does-flfpl-work-in-structured-settings"><strong>How Does FL/FPL Work in Structured Settings?</strong></h5> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Follow the Leader (FL)</strong>:<br/> FL picks the structure (e.g., path, tree) that has accumulated the lowest loss so far. However, FL is unstable in adversarial settings because a small change in losses can drastically change the optimal structure.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL)</strong>:<br/> FPL introduces random perturbations to smooth decision-making. The learner solves:</p> </li> </ul> \[w_t = \arg \min_{w \in W} \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} w \cdot x_s + w \cdot p_t\] <p>where \(p_t\) is a noise vector. This prevents overfitting to small loss differences and ensures better stability.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>FL/FPL</strong> applies well to structured problems where decisions involve combinatorial choices rather than simple finite sets.</li> <li><strong>FL</strong> works when losses are additive over substructures, but it is unstable in adversarial settings.</li> <li><strong>FPL</strong> improves stability by adding randomness, making it a powerful tool for structured online learning.</li> </ul> <p>This is why FL/FPL is commonly used in structured online learning, where actions have combinatorial dependencies, and stability is crucial.</p> <h5 id="understanding-structured-problems-an-intuition"><strong>Understanding Structured Problems: An Intuition</strong></h5> <p>Imagine you’re navigating a city using Google Maps, and every road has a <strong>traffic delay</strong> (which changes over time).</p> <p>Your goal is to pick the best route (shortest travel time) every day. The total delay you experience is the sum of individual road delays along your chosen path.</p> <p>This is an example of a <strong>structured decision problem</strong>, because:</p> <ul> <li>You’re not picking a single element (e.g., a traffic light or a road segment).</li> <li>You’re picking a structured object—a full <strong>path</strong> (set of roads that form a connected route).</li> <li>The <strong>loss</strong> (delay) of a path is determined by the sum of its parts (individual road delays).</li> </ul> <hr/> <h5 id="contrast-with-expert-based-settings"><strong>Contrast with Expert-Based Settings</strong></h5> <p>Now, contrast this with a typical <strong>expert-based setting</strong>, like a multi-armed bandit:</p> <ul> <li>If Google simply gave you a few pre-defined <strong>expert routes</strong>, and you chose among them, it wouldn’t be flexible.</li> <li>If a road suddenly gets blocked, <strong>all routes</strong> using that road become bad at once, and the whole system collapses.</li> <li><strong>Expert algorithms</strong> assume fixed actions, but in <strong>structured problems</strong>, you can dynamically build better solutions.</li> </ul> <p>Instead of treating entire routes as fixed “experts,” <strong>FL/FPL</strong> can adaptively construct the best route based on updated delays.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="why-flfpl-is-better-for-structured-problems"><strong>Why FL/FPL is Better for Structured Problems</strong></h5> <p><strong>Expert-Based Methods Struggle with Exponentially Large Action Spaces</strong></p> <p>If we use an <strong>expert-based algorithm</strong>, we’d need to maintain weights over all possible routes, but the number of possible paths grows exponentially. Instead of tracking every possible path, <strong>FL/FPL</strong> works directly with roads (substructures), summing losses efficiently.</p> <p><strong>Follow the Leader (FL) Uses the Best Past Route</strong></p> <p>In each round, FL picks the route with the <strong>lowest total delay</strong> so far. However, FL is <strong>unstable</strong>—if one road suddenly gets bad, it can completely switch to a totally different route, causing large fluctuations.</p> <p><strong>Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL) Adds Stability</strong></p> <p>Instead of blindly trusting past delays, <strong>FPL adds a small random perturbation</strong> to each road’s delay before choosing a route. This prevents overcommitting to minor variations and makes the algorithm <strong>more robust</strong> to sudden changes.</p> <p><strong>Final Takeaway:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>FL/FPL</strong> works well for structured problems where decisions are not independent (like picking a single stock) but instead composed of multiple interacting elements (like building a portfolio or choosing a route).</li> <li><strong>FL</strong> is too <strong>reactive</strong>, making drastic changes when small variations happen.</li> <li><strong>FPL</strong> stabilizes decisions, avoiding erratic shifts and leading to <strong>better long-term performance</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>This is why <strong>FL/FPL</strong> is widely used in <strong>structured online learning</strong>, like routing, combinatorial optimization, and dynamic decision-making.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="what-happens-if-we-stop-adding-perturbation-after-some-rounds-t-that-is-when-we-have-achieved-good-low-regret"><strong>What happens if we stop adding perturbation after some rounds \(T\), that is, when we have achieved good low regret?</strong></h5> <p>Great question! If you stop adding perturbations after some round \(T\) when you’ve achieved good performance and low regret, the behavior of the algorithm will change, and it will essentially revert to the <strong>Follow the Leader (FTL)</strong> strategy. This transition can have interesting consequences.</p> <p><strong>Understanding the Effect of Stopping Perturbations</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>Initial Phase with Perturbations (Exploration):</strong> <ul> <li>When you apply perturbations, the <strong>Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL)</strong> strategy introduces randomness into the decision-making process. This helps the algorithm <strong>explore</strong> different experts and prevents it from sticking to an expert that might perform poorly in the future, despite performing well in the past.</li> <li>The perturbations encourage the algorithm to occasionally “switch” experts, even if the cumulative loss of one expert is slightly better than the others. This helps to <strong>avoid overfitting</strong> to a single expert and <strong>explores new possibilities</strong>, which is particularly helpful if the environment is non-stationary or if the best expert changes over time.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>After Stopping Perturbations:</strong> <ul> <li>Once you stop adding perturbations after round \(T\), the algorithm will no longer introduce any randomness and will instead follow the expert with the lowest cumulative loss up until that point. Effectively, the algorithm will behave like <strong>Follow the Leader (FTL)</strong> after the perturbation phase.</li> <li><strong>FTL</strong> always follows the expert with the <strong>best cumulative performance</strong> (i.e., the lowest cumulative loss). If one expert has been performing better consistently, the algorithm will stick to that expert.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Possible Outcomes of Stopping Perturbations</strong></p> <p>Let’s consider a few different scenarios that can arise depending on when you stop perturbing and how the environment behaves.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Environment is Stationary (Best Expert Doesn’t Change)</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Situation</strong>: If the best expert has been consistently the best throughout all rounds, stopping the perturbations at round \(T\) will result in the algorithm behaving like <strong>FTL</strong> from round \(T\) onward.</li> <li><strong>Result</strong>: The algorithm will follow the best expert without any risk of choosing a suboptimal one. The cumulative loss will continue to accumulate for the best expert, and the regret will stay small or grow slowly.</li> <li><strong>Performance</strong>: If the best expert is already clearly the best by round \(T\), the algorithm will perform <strong>optimally</strong> from round \(T\) onward (i.e., no more regret). The cumulative regret will be close to the best expert’s cumulative loss, but there might still be a small amount of regret during the exploration phase before round \(T\).</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Environment is Non-Stationary (Best Expert Changes Over Time)</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Situation</strong>: If the best expert changes over time (e.g., due to shifts in the environment or external factors), stopping perturbations at round \(T\) might cause the algorithm to get stuck with the wrong expert.</li> <li><strong>Result</strong>: Once you stop perturbing, the algorithm might follow an expert that <strong>was the best up to round \(T\)</strong> but is no longer the best expert from that point onward.</li> <li><strong>Performance</strong>: In this case, the algorithm could suffer from <strong>increased regret</strong> after round \(T\), because it will stick with an expert that was optimal earlier but is now suboptimal. The regret will start to grow again because the algorithm has <strong>stopped exploring</strong> and is no longer adapting to changes in the environment.</li> <li><strong>Consequence</strong>: The algorithm will lose the flexibility that perturbations gave it, and it might be too slow to react to changes in the best expert. The regret could potentially grow at a <strong>linear rate</strong> after perturbations stop, similar to <strong>FTL</strong>.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Regret After Stopping Perturbations</strong> <ul> <li>If the perturbations were helping to <strong>adapt</strong> to changes in the environment, stopping them could result in the <strong>regret increasing</strong> once the environment changes and the algorithm locks onto a potentially suboptimal expert.</li> <li>The cumulative regret after round \(T\) (where perturbations stop) would depend on how well the algorithm was able to adapt and learn the best expert <strong>before</strong> the perturbations were turned off.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Long-Term Regret Bound After Stopping Perturbations</strong></p> <p>If you stop perturbing after \(T\) rounds, the regret bound will likely change.</p> <ul> <li>Before round \(T\), the regret was bounded by the <strong>\(O(\sqrt{T \log N})\)</strong> bound, due to the perturbations helping with exploration and avoiding suboptimal sticking to an expert.</li> <li>After round \(T\), once perturbations are stopped, the algorithm behaves like <strong>Follow the Leader (FTL)</strong>, and the regret bound could transition to something like:</li> </ul> \[R(T') \leq O(T' - T)\] <p>where \(T'\) is the number of rounds after you stop perturbations. Essentially, the regret will grow linearly with the number of rounds after \(T\), because the algorithm no longer explores and may follow a suboptimal expert.</p> <p>Thus, the overall regret after \(T\) rounds will be:</p> \[R(T) \leq O(\sqrt{T \log N}) + O(T' - T)\] <p>where:</p> <ul> <li>The first term accounts for the exploration phase with perturbations.</li> <li>The second term captures the linear regret that may occur once perturbations are turned off.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Optimizing the Stopping Point:</strong> To minimize the long-term regret after perturbations stop, you would want to stop perturbing at a point where:</p> <ol> <li><strong>The best expert has stabilized</strong> — meaning the algorithm has successfully identified the best expert up until round \(T\), and the environment is <strong>either stationary or predictable</strong>.</li> <li><strong>The expert switching rate is low</strong> — if the best expert has already been chosen and the environment isn’t changing much, then stopping perturbations at round \(T\) will not lead to significant regret in the long run.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Summary of Outcomes</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>If the environment is stationary</strong>, stopping perturbations at round \(T\) when good performance has been achieved is <strong>beneficial</strong> and will result in very low regret going forward, since the algorithm will just follow the best expert.</li> <li><strong>If the environment is non-stationary</strong>, stopping perturbations could lead to <strong>higher regret</strong> since the algorithm will stop adapting to new changes and could get stuck with a suboptimal expert.</li> <li>The <strong>regret bound</strong> will change after you stop perturbations. Initially, regret grows sublinearly (\(O(\sqrt{T \log N})\)), but after stopping perturbations, regret may grow linearly, like <strong>FTL</strong> (\(O(T' - T)\)).</li> </ul> <hr/> <h4 id="theoretical-bounds-for-fpl"><strong>Theoretical Bounds for FPL</strong></h4> <p>A crucial advantage of FPL is that it achieves <strong>sublinear regret</strong>, meaning that over time, its cumulative loss approaches that of the best fixed decision.

It’s also about understanding <strong>uncertainty</strong> and making informed decisions based on available data. Traditional <strong>frequentist methods</strong> typically estimate a single best-fit parameter using approaches like Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). While effective, this approach does not quantify the uncertainty in parameter estimates or predictions.</p> <p>Bayesian conditional models, on the other hand, take a <strong>probabilistic approach</strong>. Instead of committing to a single parameter estimate, they maintain a <strong>distribution over possible parameters</strong>. By incorporating prior beliefs and updating them as new data arrives, Bayesian models allow us to make <strong>predictions that inherently capture uncertainty</strong>. This is achieved through <strong>posterior predictive distributions</strong>, which average over all possible models rather than selecting just one.</p> <p>In this post, we will explore Bayesian conditional models in depth—how they work, how they differ from frequentist approaches, and how they allow for <strong>more robust decision-making under uncertainty</strong>.</p> <h4 id="bayesian-conditional-models-the-basics"><strong>Bayesian Conditional Models: The Basics</strong></h4> <p>To set up the problem, consider the following:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Input space</strong>: \(X = \mathbb{R}^d\), representing feature vectors.</li> <li><strong>Outcome space</strong>: \(Y = \mathbb{R}\), representing target values.</li> </ul> <p>A <strong>Bayesian conditional model</strong> consists of two main components:</p> <ol> <li> <p>A <strong>parametric family</strong> of conditional probability densities:</p> \[\{ p(y \mid x, \theta) : \theta \in \Theta \}\] </li> <li> <p>A <strong>prior distribution</strong> \(p(\theta)\), which represents our beliefs about \(\theta\) before observing any data.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The prior acts as a <strong>regularization mechanism</strong>, preventing overfitting by incorporating external knowledge into our model. Once we observe data, we update this prior to obtain a <strong>posterior distribution</strong> over the parameters.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Q: How does the prior prevent overfitting?</strong><br/> The prior \(p(\theta)\) assigns probability to different parameter values before seeing any data. This prevents the model from fitting noise in the data by <strong>restricting extreme values</strong> of \(\theta\). When combined with the likelihood, it balances between prior beliefs and observed data.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why does this help?</strong></p> <ul> <li>It <strong>controls model complexity</strong>, ensuring we don’t fit spurious patterns.</li> <li>It <strong>biases the model toward reasonable solutions</strong>, especially in low-data regimes.</li> <li>It <strong>smooths predictions</strong>, preventing sharp jumps caused by noisy observations.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Q: What happens after observing data?</strong><br/> The prior is updated using Bayes’ rule to form the <strong>posterior</strong>:</p> \[p(\theta \mid D) \propto p(D \mid \theta) p(\theta)\] <p>This posterior now reflects both the <strong>initial beliefs</strong> and the <strong>information from the data</strong>, striking a balance between flexibility and regularization.</p> <p><strong>Q: How is this similar to frequentist regularization?</strong><br/> In frequentist methods, regularization terms (e.g., L2 in ridge regression) <strong>penalize large parameter values</strong>. Bayesian priors achieve a similar effect, but instead of a fixed penalty, they provide a <strong>probabilistic framework</strong> that adapts as more data is observed.</p> <p>Thus, the prior serves as a <strong>principled way to regularize models</strong>, ensuring robustness while allowing adaptation as more evidence accumulates.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="the-posterior-distribution"><strong>The Posterior Distribution</strong></h5> <p>The <strong>posterior distribution</strong> is the foundation of Bayesian inference. It represents our updated belief about the parameter \(\theta\) after observing data \(D\). Using <strong>Bayes’ theorem</strong>, we compute:</p> \[p(\theta \mid D, x) \propto p(D \mid \theta, x) p(\theta)\] <p>where:</p> <ul> <li>\(p(D \mid \theta, x)\) is the <strong>likelihood function</strong> \(L_D(\theta)\), describing how likely the data is given the parameter \(\theta\).</li> <li>\(p(\theta)\) is the <strong>prior</strong> distribution, encoding our prior knowledge about \(\theta\).</li> </ul> <p>This updated posterior distribution allows us to make <strong>probabilistically sound predictions</strong> while explicitly incorporating uncertainty.</p> <h5 id="estimating-parameters-point-estimates"><strong>Estimating Parameters: Point Estimates</strong></h5> <p>While Bayesian inference provides a full posterior distribution over \(\theta\), sometimes we may need a single point estimate. Different choices arise depending on the loss function we minimize:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Posterior mean</strong>:</p> \[\hat{\theta} = \mathbb{E}[\theta \mid D, x]\] <p>This minimizes squared error loss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Posterior median</strong>:</p> \[\hat{\theta} = \text{median}(\theta \mid D, x)\] <p>This minimizes absolute error loss.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate</strong>:</p> \[\hat{\theta} = \arg\max_{\theta \in \Theta} p(\theta \mid D, x)\] <p>This finds the most probable parameter value under the posterior.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each approach has its advantages, and the choice depends on the <strong>application and the cost of different types of errors</strong>.</p> <h4 id="bayesian-prediction-function"><strong>Bayesian Prediction Function</strong></h4> <p>The goal of any supervised learning method is to learn a function that maps input \(x \in X\) to a distribution over outputs \(Y\). The key difference between frequentist and Bayesian approaches lies in how they achieve this.</p> <h5 id="frequentist-approach"><strong>Frequentist Approach</strong></h5> <p>In a frequentist framework:</p> <ol> <li>We choose a <strong>hypothesis space</strong>—a family of conditional probability densities.</li> <li>We estimate a single best-fit parameter \(\hat{\theta}(D)\) using MLE or another optimization method.</li> <li>We make predictions using \(p(y \mid x, \hat{\theta}(D))\), ignoring uncertainty in \(\theta\).</li> </ol> <h5 id="bayesian-approach"><strong>Bayesian Approach</strong></h5> <p>In contrast, Bayesian methods:</p> <ol> <li>Define a <strong>parametric family</strong> of conditional densities \(\{ p(y \mid x, \theta) : \theta \in \Theta \}\).</li> <li>Specify a <strong>prior distribution</strong> \(p(\theta)\).</li> <li>Instead of selecting a single best-fit \(\theta\), integrate over all possible parameters using the posterior.</li> </ol> <p>This results in a <strong>predictive distribution</strong> that <strong>preserves model uncertainty</strong> rather than discarding it.</p> <h5 id="the-prior-and-posterior-predictive-distributions"><strong>The Prior and Posterior Predictive Distributions</strong></h5> <p>Even before observing any data, we can make predictions using the <strong>prior predictive distribution</strong>:</p> \[p(y \mid x) = \int p(y \mid x, \theta) p(\theta) d\theta\] <p>This represents an average over all conditional densities, weighted by the prior \(p(\theta)\). Once we observe data \(D\), we compute the <strong>posterior predictive distribution</strong>:</p> \[p(y \mid x, D) = \int p(y \mid x, \theta) p(\theta \mid D) d\theta\] <p>This distribution takes into account both the likelihood and prior, providing <strong>updated predictions</strong> that reflect the data.</p> <p>[How to make intuitive sense of this? and What happens if we do this? and What if not?]</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Q: How does the prior predictive distribution get its value? What does it mean to make predictions before observing data, and how does this function account for it?</strong></p> <p>The prior predictive distribution represents predictions before observing data, and it accounts for the uncertainty in the model parameters by averaging over all possible values of the parameters based on the prior distribution. It essentially captures the expected predictions by integrating over the entire parameter space, weighted by the prior beliefs about the parameters.</p> <p>Mathematically, the prior predictive distribution is given by: \(p(y \mid x) = \int p(y \mid x, \theta) p(\theta) d\theta\)</p> <p>Here’s how it works:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Prior Distribution \(p(\theta)\):</strong><br/> This reflects our beliefs about the parameters \(\theta\) before any data is observed. It could be based on prior knowledge or assumptions about the parameters’ likely values.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Likelihood \(p(y \mid x, \theta)\):</strong><br/> This describes the model that predicts the outcome \(y\) given the input data \(x\) and the parameters \(\theta\). It represents the relationship between the parameters and the predicted outcomes.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Prior Predictive Distribution:</strong><br/> The integral sums over all possible values of \(\theta\), weighted by the prior distribution \(p(\theta)\), and gives the expected outcome \(y\). It represents predictions before any data is observed by averaging over the entire parameter space as described by the prior distribution.</p> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Conceptually:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Predictions before observing data</strong> means we are making predictions based on our beliefs about the parameters, without any data to inform us.</li> <li>The prior predictive distribution is essentially a <strong>preliminary prediction</strong> that incorporates uncertainty about the parameters, providing a forecast based on the prior assumptions, rather than the actual data.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Example:</strong></p> <p>If we were predicting the height of individuals based on age and gender, the prior predictive distribution would give us an expected distribution of heights based on our prior assumptions about average height and variation, before any actual data on height is observed.</p> <p><strong>Why is it useful?</strong></p> <p>The prior predictive distribution gives us an initial understanding of what predictions might look like before data is available, incorporating prior knowledge about the parameters. However, once data is observed, this prediction is updated using the posterior predictive distribution, which integrates both prior beliefs and observed data.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why use the posterior predictive distribution?</strong></p> <ul> <li>It refines predictions using observed data.</li> <li>It accounts for uncertainty by integrating over posterior \(p(\theta \mid D)\).</li> <li>It prevents overconfident predictions from a single parameter estimate.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Q: What if we don’t use it?</strong></p> <ul> <li>Using only the prior predictive distribution leads to uninformed predictions.</li> <li>Relying on a single \(\theta\) (e.g., MLE) ignores uncertainty, increasing overconfidence.</li> <li>Ignoring parameter uncertainty may lead to suboptimal decisions.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Q: Is Integrating Over \(\theta\) the Same as Marginalizing It?</strong></p> <p>Yes, integrating over \(\theta\) in Bayesian inference is effectively <strong>marginalizing</strong> it out. When computing the <strong>posterior predictive distribution</strong>,</p> \[p(y \mid x, D) = \int p(y \mid x, \theta) p(\theta \mid D) d\theta\] <p>we sum (integrate) over all possible values of \(\theta\), weighted by their posterior probability \(p(\theta \mid D)\). This removes \(\theta\) as an explicit parameter, ensuring predictions reflect all plausible values rather than relying on a single estimate. In contrast, frequentist methods select a single \(\hat{\theta}\) (e.g., MLE or MAP), which does not account for uncertainty in \(\theta\). By marginalizing \(\theta\), Bayesian inference naturally incorporates parameter uncertainty, leading to more robust and well-calibrated predictions.</p> <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The posterior predictive distribution provides well-calibrated, data-driven predictions while maintaining uncertainty estimates.</p> <blockquote> <p>Bayesian Analogy: A Detective Solving a Case</p> </blockquote> <h5 id="1-prior--what-you-know-before-the-investigation"><strong>1. Prior – What You Know Before the Investigation</strong></h5> <p>Imagine you’re a detective assigned to a case. Before you’ve looked at any clues or evidence (i.e., before observing any data), you have some <strong>prior beliefs</strong> based on your experience or intuition about the suspect.</p> <p>For example, maybe based on past cases, you believe the suspect is likely to be someone in their 30s (that’s your <strong>prior</strong> belief). It could be based on things like:</p> <ul> <li>Crime trends (e.g., most crimes in this area are committed by people in their 30s).</li> <li>Hunches or experience (e.g., in your line of work, you’ve seen that younger suspects tend to get caught more easily, so older individuals are more likely to be the culprits).</li> </ul> <p>This <strong>prior belief</strong> about who the suspect might be is like the <strong>prior distribution</strong> in Bayesian statistics—it’s your <strong>best guess</strong> before you have any real evidence (data).</p> <h5 id="2-likelihood--how-the-clues-fit-the-suspect"><strong>2. Likelihood – How the Clues Fit the Suspect</strong></h5> <p>Now, you start finding <strong>clues</strong> (data) that might suggest a certain suspect. The clues don’t give you the full picture, but they help you refine your guess.</p> <p>Let’s say you find a footprint at the crime scene, and based on your knowledge, the likelihood that someone in their 30s leaves this kind of print is relatively high. But the likelihood is not zero for other age groups either—it’s just higher for people in their 30s.</p> <p>In Bayesian terms, <strong>likelihood</strong> is how <strong>likely</strong> it is to see the data (e.g., the footprint) given different possible values for your parameters (e.g., the age of the suspect). You’re comparing the fit of each possible age (parameter) to the actual clue.</p> <h5 id="3-posterior--your-updated-belief-after-seeing-the-clues"><strong>3. Posterior – Your Updated Belief After Seeing the Clues</strong></h5> <p>Once you have both your <strong>prior belief</strong> and the <strong>clues</strong>, you combine them to get a better sense of who the suspect might be. This process is called <strong>updating your belief</strong>.</p> <p>So, after considering the clue (e.g., the footprint), you revise your initial guess. Maybe, now that you know the footprint matches your original suspicion of a person in their 30s, you <strong>update</strong> your belief to make it even <strong>stronger</strong>.</p> <p>In Bayesian terms, this is the <strong>posterior distribution</strong>: it’s the updated belief about the parameters (e.g., the suspect’s age) <strong>after incorporating the new data (evidence)</strong>. The posterior combines your <strong>prior</strong> belief and the <strong>likelihood</strong> of the evidence, giving you a new <strong>posterior</strong> that reflects both.</p> <h5 id="4-integrating--considering-all-possibilities"><strong>4. Integrating – Considering All Possibilities</strong></h5> <p>Finally, to update your belief, you need to <strong>integrate</strong> all the possibilities. For example, you might not be 100% sure that the suspect is in their 30s, but you know that they’re more likely to be in that age group than in their 40s or 20s. You <strong>integrate</strong> over all the possible ages by weighing them by how probable each one is (based on the prior belief and likelihood).</p> <p>This is where the <strong>integration</strong> comes in. In Bayesian terms, you’re averaging over all possible values (ages) to get the best <strong>overall</strong> estimate of the suspect’s age (which is the posterior). You’re not just picking the most likely answer; you’re considering all the possibilities and combining them in a way that incorporates both your prior and the evidence you’ve gathered.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="making-point-predictions-from-py-mid-x-d"><strong>Making Point Predictions from \(p(y \mid x, D)\)</strong></h5> <p>Once we have the full predictive distribution, we can extract <strong>point predictions</strong> depending on the loss function we wish to minimize:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mean prediction</strong> (minimizing squared error loss):</p> \[\mathbb{E}[y \mid x, D]\] </li> <li> <p><strong>Median prediction</strong> (minimizing absolute error loss):</p> \[\text{median}(y \mid x, D)\] </li> <li> <p><strong>Mode (MAP estimate of \(y\))</strong> (minimizing 0/1 loss):</p> \[\arg\max_{y \in Y} p(y \mid x, D)\] </li> </ul> <p>Each of these choices is derived directly from the <strong>posterior predictive distribution</strong>, making Bayesian methods highly flexible for different objectives.</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>Okay, everything makes sense now—at least somewhat.

Stay tuned, and see you in the next one👋!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ML-NYU"/><category term="ML"/><category term="Math"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learn how Bayesian conditional models leverage prior knowledge, posterior updates, and predictive distributions to make principled, uncertainty-aware predictions in machine learning.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On-line to Batch Conversion</title><link href="https://monishver11.github.io/blog/2025/online-to-batch/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On-line to Batch Conversion"/><published>2025-01-30T15:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-30T15:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://monishver11.github.io/blog/2025/online-to-batch</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://monishver11.github.io/blog/2025/online-to-batch/"><![CDATA[<p>In previous sections, we explored various algorithms for online learning, such as the <strong>Perceptron</strong> and <strong>Winnow algorithms</strong>, analyzing their performance within the <strong>mistake model</strong>—a setting where no assumptions are made about how the training sequence is generated.</p> <p>A natural question arises:</p> <blockquote> <p>Can these algorithms be leveraged to derive hypotheses with <strong>small generalization error</strong> in a standard <strong>stochastic setting</strong>?<br/> Moreover, how can the intermediate hypotheses they generate be combined to form an <strong>accurate predictor</strong>?</p> </blockquote> <p>These questions are the focus of this section.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="problem-setup"><strong>Problem Setup</strong></h5> <p>We consider a <strong>supervised learning</strong> setting where we have a labeled sample:</p> \[S = \{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_T, y_T)\} \subset (X \times Y)^T\] <p>drawn <strong>i.i.d.</strong> from some unknown but fixed distribution \(D\).</p> <p>Let \(H\) be a <strong>hypothesis class</strong> consisting of functions mapping \(X\) to \(Y'\), and let \(L: Y' \times Y \to \mathbb{R}^+\) be a <strong>bounded loss function</strong>, meaning there exists a constant \(M \geq 0\) such that:</p> \[L \leq M.\] <p>An <strong>online learning algorithm</strong> \(A\) sequentially processes the dataset \(S\), generating hypotheses:</p> \[h_1, h_2, \dots, h_T \in H.\] <p>It starts with an initial hypothesis \(h_1\) and updates it after processing each training example \((x_t, y_t)\), for \(t \in [T]\).</p> <hr/> <h4 id="regret-and-generalization-error"><strong>Regret and Generalization Error</strong></h4> <p>Before we tackle the question we started with, let’s first clarify why it’s important to address it. Also, let’s define the key terms and concepts to ensure everything is clear and aligned as we proceed.</p> <h5 id="1-regret">1. <strong>Regret:</strong></h5> <p>The <strong>regret</strong> of an algorithm is a measure of how much worse the algorithm’s performance is compared to the best possible hypothesis in the class \(H\), in hindsight.</p> <p>Formally, it’s defined as:</p> \[R_T = \sum_{t=1}^{T} L(h_t(x_t), y_t) - \min_{h \in H} \sum_{t=1}^{T} L(h(x_t), y_t)\] <p>Let’s break this down:</p> <ul> <li>\(h_t(x_t)\) is the prediction of the algorithm at time \(t\), after processing the \(t\)-th training example \((x_t, y_t)\).</li> <li>The term \(\sum_{t=1}^{T} L(h_t(x_t), y_t)\) is the total loss the algorithm incurs by predicting \(h_t(x_t)\) for each training example.</li> <li>\(\min_{h \in H} \sum_{t=1}^{T} L(h(x_t), y_t)\) represents the loss of the best hypothesis \(h \in H\) if it were chosen in advance and used to predict every \(x_t\) in the sequence.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Why regret matters:</strong><br/> Regret tells us how far off the algorithm’s performance is compared to the best possible performance it could have had with a perfect hypothesis. If the regret is small, it means the algorithm is making predictions that are close to the best possible predictions, at least in terms of total loss.</p> <h5 id="2-generalization-error">2. <strong>Generalization Error:</strong></h5> <p>The <strong>generalization error</strong> of a hypothesis \(h \in H\) refers to how well it performs on unseen data from the same distribution \(D\), and it’s typically measured by the <strong>expected loss</strong>:</p> \[R(h) = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim D} [L(h(x), y)]\] <p>In other words, the generalization error measures how well the hypothesis \(h\) performs on future data (or on data drawn from the same distribution) as opposed to just the training data. This is crucial because we want our hypothesis to not just perform well on the training set (which can be overfit) but also to generalize well to new, unseen examples.</p> <p><strong>How does this tie into the problem setup?</strong><br/> The goal in this section is to bound the <strong>average generalization error</strong> of the sequence of hypotheses \(h_1, h_2, \dots, h_T\) generated by the algorithm \(A\). You want to know if the algorithm can generate hypotheses whose <strong>average loss</strong> on the training dataset \(S\) is a good predictor of their <strong>generalization error</strong>—meaning, will the algorithm’s performance on the training set reflect its performance on unseen data?</p> <h5 id="connecting-regret-to-generalization-error"><strong>Connecting Regret to Generalization Error:</strong></h5> <p>Now, let’s dive into the key insight of this section:</p> <ul> <li>The algorithm generates a sequence of hypotheses \(h_1, h_2, \dots, h_T\), but we don’t necessarily care about each individual hypothesis. Rather, we care about the <strong>average performance</strong> over all of them.</li> </ul> <p>Let’s assume the <strong>average loss</strong> of the hypotheses on the training data is:</p> \[\hat{L} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} L(h_t(x_t), y_t)\] <p>The idea is that, if the average loss \(\hat{L}\) is small (i.e., the algorithm has done well on the training set), then the <strong>generalization error</strong> (i.e., the expected loss on unseen data) should also be small. The question here is how small, and whether we can bound this generalization error using the average loss on the training set.</p> <h5 id="key-insights-and-the-challenge"><strong>Key Insights and the Challenge:</strong></h5> <p>The big challenge in this problem setup is to establish a <strong>connection between regret and generalization error</strong>. Specifically, you are interested in showing that even though the algorithm has no prior knowledge of the distribution \(D\), the average loss of the hypotheses it generates will give you a good idea of their <strong>generalization performance</strong>.</p> <h5 id="how-do-we-approach-this"><strong>How do we approach this?</strong></h5> <p>To answer the question of how to use the average loss to bound the generalization error, we might use tools from <strong>PAC learning</strong> (Probably Approximately Correct) theory, where we can bound the generalization error of a hypothesis by looking at its empirical loss on the training set and how much variability exists due to the randomness in the sampling process.</p> <p>In simple terms:</p> <ul> <li>If the training loss is small, can we show that the hypothesis will likely also perform well on unseen data?</li> <li>Can we bound how much the training loss differs from the generalization error for the hypotheses \(h_1, h_2, \dots, h_T\)?</li> </ul> <p>This section would likely explore these questions in greater detail, using concepts such as <strong>concentration inequalities</strong> (e.g., Hoeffding’s inequality) or tools from statistical learning theory (e.g., uniform convergence) to establish these bounds.</p> <h5 id="key-takeaways"><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h5> <ul> <li><strong>Regret</strong> measures how well the algorithm’s performance compares to the best possible hypothesis over the sequence.</li> <li><strong>Generalization error</strong> measures how well a hypothesis performs on new, unseen data.</li> <li>The main goal is to relate the <strong>average loss</strong> of the hypotheses generated by the online algorithm to their <strong>generalization error</strong>, so that we can prove the algorithm produces good generalizers, not just good fitters to the training data.</li> </ul> <p>Alright, we’re all set! Now, let’s take a look at the actual bounds that are available.</p> <hr/> <h4 id="generalization-error-bound"><strong>Generalization Error Bound</strong></h4> <p>The following lemma provides a bound on the average generalization error in terms of the empirical loss:</p> <h5 id="lemma-814"><strong>Lemma 8.14</strong></h5> <p>Let \(S = \{(x_1,y_1), ..., (x_T,y_T)\}\) be an i.i.d. sample from \(D\), and let \(h_1, ..., h_T\) be the sequence of hypotheses generated by an online algorithm \(A\) processing \(S\). If the loss function is bounded by \(M\), then for any \(\delta &gt; 0\), with probability at least \(1 - \delta\):</p> \[\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} R(h_t) \leq \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} L(h_t(x_t), y_t) + M \sqrt{\frac{2 \log(1/\delta)}{T}}\] <h5 id="proof-sketch"><strong>Proof Sketch:</strong></h5> <p>We begin by defining the random variable:</p> \[V_t = R(h_t) - L(h_t(x_t), y_t)\] <p>This represents the difference between the <strong>true expected loss</strong> (generalization error) of \(h_t\) and the <strong>empirical loss</strong> observed on the sample \((x_t, y_t)\).</p> <p><strong>Step 1: Establishing Expectation Property</strong></p> <p>Since the data points \((x_t, y_t)\) are drawn <strong>i.i.d.</strong> from the distribution \(D\), the expectation of the empirical loss over the randomness in the sample should match the expected loss:</p> \[\mathbb{E}[L(h_t(x_t), y_t) | h_t] = R(h_t)\] <p>Rearranging this gives:</p> \[\mathbb{E}[V_t | x_1, ..., x_{t-1}] = R(h_t) - \mathbb{E}[L(h_t(x_t), y_t) | h_t] = 0\] <p>Thus, the sequence \(\{V_t\}_{t=1}^{T}\) forms a <strong>martingale difference sequence</strong>, meaning that the expected value of \(V_t\) at any step remains zero given all past observations. This ensures that there is no systematic drift in expectations.</p> <p>This means that knowing past values does not help predict the next value’s expectation—it remains centered around zero. No systematic drift means that the sequence does not consistently increase or decrease over time; it behaves like a fair game in probability.</p> <p><strong>Step 2: Bounding the Range of \(V_t\)</strong></p> <p>Since the loss function is <strong>bounded</strong> by \(M\), we get:</p> \[L(h_t(x_t), y_t) \in [0, M] \quad \Rightarrow \quad V_t = R(h_t) - L(h_t(x_t), y_t) \in [-M, +M]\] <p>This ensures that \(V_t\) is always within a fixed range.</p> <p><strong>Step 3: Applying Azuma’s Inequality</strong></p> <p>Azuma’s inequality states that for a martingale difference sequence \(V_t\) with bounded differences \(\vert V_t \vert \leq M\), the probability of the empirical mean deviating from its expectation satisfies:</p> \[P\left( \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} V_t \geq \epsilon \right) \leq \exp \left( -\frac{2T\epsilon^2}{4M^2} \right)\] <p>Rearranging the denominator:</p> \[P\left( \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} V_t \geq \epsilon \right) \leq \exp \left( -\frac{T\epsilon^2}{2M^2} \right)\] <p><strong>Step 4: Solving for \(\epsilon\)</strong></p> <p>We now set the right-hand side equal to \(\delta &gt; 0\):</p> \[\exp \left( -\frac{T\epsilon^2}{2M^2} \right) = \delta\] <p>Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:</p> \[-\frac{T\epsilon^2}{2M^2} = \log \delta\] <p>Solving for \(\epsilon\):</p> \[\epsilon = M \sqrt{\frac{2 \log(1/\delta)}{T}}\] <p><strong>Step 5: Concluding the Bound</strong></p> <p>Since \(\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} V_t\) represents the difference between the <strong>average generalization error</strong> and the <strong>empirical average loss</strong>, we obtain:</p> \[\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} R(h_t) \leq \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} L(h_t(x_t), y_t) + M \sqrt{\frac{2 \log(1/\delta)}{T}}\] <p>This completes the proof.</p> <hr/> <p>Before we move forward, let’s break down what all of this means and how we’re using it to reach our desired outcome.</p> <h5 id="why-does-the-martingale-difference-property-allow-us-to-apply-azumas-inequality"><strong>Why does the martingale difference property allow us to apply Azuma’s inequality?</strong></h5> <ul> <li>The key idea of a <strong>martingale difference sequence</strong> is that at each step, the expectation of the difference \(V_t\) is <strong>zero</strong> given past observations.</li> <li>This means that on average, the sequence doesn’t drift systematically in any direction—it’s <strong>balanced</strong> in expectation.</li> <li>Moreover, since each \(V_t\) is <strong>bounded</strong> within \([-M, M]\), there are no extreme jumps.</li> <li><strong>Azuma’s inequality</strong> applies precisely in such cases—it tells us that despite small fluctuations at each step, the <strong>cumulative deviation from zero</strong> remains <strong>small with high probability</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>💡 <strong>Analogy:</strong> Imagine you’re walking on a balance beam with a safety harness.</p> <ul> <li>You might take small steps to the left or right, but <strong>each step is unbiased</strong>, meaning you’re not favoring one direction over time.</li> <li>Also, your steps are limited in size (bounded).</li> <li><strong>Azuma’s inequality is like saying that, with high probability, you won’t drift too far from the center because of these properties.</strong></li> </ul> <h5 id="how-does-this-help-bound-generalization-error"><strong>How does this help bound generalization error?</strong></h5> <ul> <li>The empirical loss over the training sample is what we observe, but what we <strong>really care about</strong> is the generalization error (expected loss over unseen data).</li> <li>The sum \(\sum_{t=1}^{T} V_t\) captures how much our empirical loss <strong>deviates</strong> from the true generalization error.</li> <li>Since we established that this deviation behaves like a <strong>martingale difference sequence</strong>, we can now use Azuma’s inequality to show that this deviation is <strong>small with high probability</strong>.</li> <li><strong>This means that our empirical loss is a good estimate of the true generalization error, up to a small correction term!</strong></li> </ul> <p>💡 <strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of a weather forecast model trained on past temperature data.</p> <ul> <li>If the model is unbiased and doesn’t systematically overestimate or underestimate temperatures, then <strong>on average</strong>, its predictions should be close to reality.</li> <li><strong>Azuma’s inequality tells us that, with high probability, the difference between past observed temperatures (empirical loss) and future actual temperatures (generalization error) remains small.</strong></li> <li>This justifies why our training loss is a <strong>reliable estimate</strong> of test loss.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h4 id="application-averaging-hypotheses"><strong>Application: Averaging Hypotheses</strong></h4> <p>When the loss function is <strong>convex</strong> in its first argument, we can bound the generalization error of the <strong>average hypothesis</strong>:</p> \[\bar{h} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} h_t\] <p>Since expectation is <strong>linear</strong>, we can use <strong>Jensen’s inequality</strong>, which states that for a convex function \(f\):</p> \[f\left(\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} x_t\right) \leq \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} f(x_t)\] <p>Applying this to the generalization error:</p> \[R(\bar{h}) = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim D} [L(\bar{h}(x), y)]\] <p>By convexity of \(L\), we get:</p> \[R(\bar{h}) \leq \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} R(h_t)\] <p>From our previous bound:</p> \[\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} R(h_t) \leq \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} L(h_t(x_t), y_t) + M \sqrt{\frac{2 \log(1/\delta)}{T}}\] <p>Thus, we obtain:</p> \[R(\bar{h}) \leq \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} L(h_t(x_t), y_t) + M \sqrt{\frac{2 \log(1/\delta)}{T}}\] <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong></p> <ul> <li>The generalization error of the <strong>averaged</strong> hypothesis is controlled by the <strong>average loss</strong> of the individual hypotheses plus a small correction term.</li> <li>This shows that averaging hypotheses is a simple yet powerful way to obtain a <strong>low generalization error</strong> in an online learning setting.</li> </ul> <h5 id="connection-to-regret-minimization"><strong>Connection to Regret Minimization</strong></h5> <p>If the online learning algorithm has <strong>small regret</strong> \(R_T\), then:</p> \[\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} L(h_t(x_t), y_t) \approx \inf_{h \in H} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} L(h(x_t), y_t)\] <p>Since the second term in our bound vanishes as \(T \to \infty\), we conclude:</p> \[R(\bar{h}) \approx \inf_{h \in H} R(h)\] <p>This means that the average hypothesis is nearly <strong>optimal</strong> in terms of generalization error.</p> <p>If the above result feels a bit half-baked for you to process, no worries—we’ll work through it and figure out

Here’s how this works step by step:</p> <p><strong>1. Maintaining Expert Weights</strong></p> <ul> <li>We assign an initial weight to each expert, typically \(w_i^{(1)} = 1\) for all experts \(i\).</li> <li>Over time, we <strong>update the weights</strong> of experts based on their performance, penalizing those who make mistakes.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Making Probabilistic Predictions</strong></p> <ul> <li>Instead of deterministically following the best expert (which an adversary could exploit), RWM <strong>randomly selects a prediction</strong> based on the current expert weights.</li> <li>The probability of choosing a particular expert’s prediction is proportional to their weight: \(P(y_t = y_i) = \frac{w_i^{(t)}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} w_j^{(t)}}\)<br/> where \(w_i^{(t)}\) is the weight of expert \(i\) at time \(t\).</li> <li>This means that if an expert has a high weight (i.e., has made fewer mistakes), their prediction is <strong>more likely</strong> to be chosen, but not always.</li> <li>If an adversary tries to force mistakes by targeting a specific deterministic strategy, the randomization ensures that the algorithm <strong>does not always follow a single pattern</strong>, making it harder for the adversary to exploit.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Weight Update Rule</strong></p> <ul> <li>After making a prediction, the algorithm observes the true outcome \(y_t\).</li> <li>The weights of experts who made mistakes are <strong>exponentially decreased</strong> using a multiplicative update rule: \(w_i^{(t+1)} = w_i^{(t)} \cdot \beta^{\ell_i^{(t)}}\)<br/> where: <ul> <li>\(\ell_i^{(t)}\) is the loss (1 if the expert made a mistake, 0 otherwise),</li> <li>\(\beta \in (0,1)\) is a parameter that determines how aggressively the weights are updated.</li> </ul> </li> <li>This ensures that over time, experts who consistently make mistakes lose influence, while those with good predictions gain more say in future predictions.</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Why This Prevents Repeated Mistakes</strong></p> <ul> <li>Since the algorithm chooses predictions probabilistically, it does not <strong>consistently</strong> make the same mistakes like a deterministic algorithm would.</li> <li>Even if an adversary tries to construct a sequence that forces a mistake, RWM’s randomization means that <strong>the same incorrect choice won’t always be made</strong>.</li> <li>Moreover, since weights adjust dynamically, experts who perform better in the long run <strong>gradually dominate</strong> the prediction process.</li> </ul> <h5 id="takeaways"><strong><mark>Takeaways:</mark></strong></h5> <ul> <li><strong>Randomization prevents predictable failures</strong>: The algorithm does not follow a fixed pattern, making it harder for an adversary to force mistakes.</li> <li><strong>Probabilities favor better experts</strong>: Instead of blindly following one expert, the algorithm balances between exploration (randomization) and exploitation (favoring high-weight experts).</li> <li><strong>Weights adjust over time</strong>: Poor-performing experts lose influence, ensuring the algorithm improves as more data is observed.</li> </ul> <p>By incorporating randomness, the <strong>Randomized Weighted Majority Algorithm</strong> provides a <strong>powerful and adaptive approach</strong> to online learning, making it a fundamental tool in adversarial learning settings.</p> <hr/> <p>Here’s an analogy to make the <strong>Randomized Weighted Majority (RWM) algorithm</strong> more intuitive:</p> <p>Imagine you are in a <strong>new city</strong> for an extended stay, and you have to decide <strong>where to eat dinner every night</strong>. There are multiple restaurants (experts), and each night, you choose one based on your past experiences.</p> <p><strong>1. Initial Equal Preference (Assigning Weights)</strong></p> <p>At the start, you <strong>have no idea</strong> which restaurant is the best. So, you assign them equal preference:</p> <ul> <li>Restaurant A, B, and C all seem equally good, so you <strong>randomly pick one</strong>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Evaluating Performance (Tracking Mistakes)</strong></p> <p>Each time you eat at a restaurant, you observe whether the meal was <strong>good</strong> or <strong>bad</strong>.</p> <ul> <li>If the meal was great, you <strong>trust the restaurant more</strong>.</li> <li>If it was terrible, you <strong>trust it less</strong>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Adjusting Your Choices Over Time (Weight Updates)</strong></p> <p>Instead of always sticking to a single restaurant (which might backfire if it suddenly declines in quality), you <strong>adjust your preferences probabilistically</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>If <strong>Restaurant A</strong> has served consistently good food, you start <strong>choosing it more often</strong>, but you <strong>don’t completely ignore</strong> B and C.</li> <li>If <strong>Restaurant B</strong> has had a few bad meals, you reduce your visits there <strong>but still give it a chance occasionally</strong>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Why Randomization Helps</strong></p> <p>Imagine there’s a <strong>food critic (the adversary)</strong> trying to ruin your dining experience.</p> <ul> <li>If you <strong>always follow a deterministic rule</strong> (e.g., always picking the currently best restaurant), the critic can <strong>sabotage your choices</strong>—perhaps by tipping off the restaurant to serve bad food only when you visit.</li> <li>However, by <strong>randomizing your choices</strong> (with a bias toward better restaurants), the critic <strong>can’t predict where you’ll go</strong>, making it much harder to force repeated bad experiences.</li> </ul> <p><strong>5. Long-Term Adaptation (Minimizing Regret)</strong></p> <p>Over time, bad restaurants get <strong>fewer chances</strong>, and good ones <strong>dominate your choices</strong>. But, because you <strong>never completely eliminate</strong> any option, you still have room to adjust if a once-bad restaurant improves.</p> <h5 id="mapping-back-to-rwm"><strong>Mapping Back to RWM</strong></h5> <ul> <li><strong>Restaurants = Experts</strong></li> <li><strong>Your decision = Algorithm’s prediction</strong></li> <li><strong>Good meal = Correct prediction (no loss)</strong></li> <li><strong>Bad meal = Mistake (loss)</strong></li> <li><strong>Reducing visits to bad restaurants = Lowering expert weights</strong></li> <li><strong>Randomly choosing where to eat = Making probabilistic predictions</strong></li> </ul> <p>By <strong>not always following the same pattern</strong>, you prevent predictable failures and <strong>gradually learn the best strategy</strong> while adapting to changes.</p> <hr/> <h4 id="randomized-weighted-majority-algorithm-regret-bound-and-proof"><strong>Randomized Weighted Majority Algorithm: Regret Bound and Proof</strong></h4> <p>The main objective of the RWM algorithm is to minimize the <strong>regret</strong>, which is the difference between the cumulative loss of the algorithm and that of the best possible decision (in hindsight) over time.</p> <p>Now, we’ll dive into the <strong>regret bound</strong> for the RWM algorithm.

We derive upper and lower bounds for \(W_t\) and combine them to establish the regret bound.</p> <p>Let’s walk through the key steps of the proof.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Step 1: The Weight Update Rule</strong> The weight of expert \(i\) at round \(t+1\) is updated based on their incurred loss \(l_{t,i}\):</p> \[w_{t+1, i} = \begin{cases} w_{t, i} \cdot \beta, &amp; \text{if } l_{t, i} = 1 \\ w_{t, i}, &amp; \text{if } l_{t, i} = 0 \end{cases}\] <p>where \(\beta \in (0,1)\) is a fixed discount factor.</p> <p>The total weight at round \(t+1\) is then:</p> \[W_{t+1} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{t+1, i}\] <hr/> <p><strong>Step 2: Evolution of Total Weight</strong> Using the update rule, we can express \(W_{t+1}\) in terms of \(W_t\):</p> \[W_{t+1} = \sum_{i: l_{t,i} = 0} w_{t,i} + \beta \sum_{i: l_{t,i} = 1} w_{t,i}\] \[= W_t + (\beta - 1) \sum_{i: l_{t,i} = 1} w_{t,i}\] \[= W_t + (\beta - 1) W_t \sum_{i: l_{t,i} = 1} p_{t,i}\] \[= W_t + (\beta - 1) W_t L_t\] \[= W_t (1 - (1 - \beta) L_t)\] <hr/> <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’re unsure, refer to the items listed below, which should be used appropriately to achieve the desired result.</p> <p>Using the probability interpretation of the weights:</p> \[\sum_{i: l_{t,i}=1} w_{t,i} = W_t L_t,\] <p>where \(L_t\) is the expected loss at time \(t\):</p> \[L_t = \sum_{i=1}^{N} p_{t,i} l_{t,i}\] <p>Thus, we obtain:</p> \[W_{t+1} = W_t(1 - (1 - \beta) L_t)\] <hr/> <p>By recursion, since \(W_1 = N\), we get:</p> \[W_{T+1} = N \prod_{t=1}^{T} (1 - (1 - \beta) L_t)\] <hr/> <p><strong>Step 3: Lower Bound on \(W_{T+1}\)</strong> The minimum weight of any expert at round \(T+1\) satisfies:</p> \[W_{T+1} \geq \max_{i \in [N]} w_{T+1, i} = \beta^{\mathcal{L}_T^{\min}}\] <p>where \(\mathcal{L}_T^{\min}\) is the loss of the best expert.</p> <p>How did we arrive at this version?</p> <p>Each expert’s weight evolves according to the <strong>multiplicative update rule</strong>. If expert \(i\) incurs a loss \(l_{t,i}\) at round \(t\), its weight is updated as:</p> \[w_{t+1, i} = w_{t,i} \cdot \beta^{l_{t,i}}\] <p>where \(\beta \in (0,1]\) is the update factor.</p> <p>Define the <strong>best expert</strong> as the one with the <strong>minimum cumulative loss</strong> over \(T\) rounds. Let \(\mathcal{L}_T^{\min}\) denote this minimum loss:</p> \[\mathcal{L}_T^{\min} = \min_{i \in [N]} \sum_{t=1}^{T} l_{t,i}\] <p>For this best expert (say expert \(i^*\)), its weight after \(T\) rounds evolves as:</p> \[w_{T+1, i^*} = w_{1, i^*} \cdot \prod_{t=1}^{T} \beta^{l_{t,i^*}}\] <p>Since all experts start with an equal initial weight \(w_{1, i} = 1\) (assuming uniform initialization), we have:</p> \[w_{T+1, i^*} = \beta^{\mathcal{L}_T^{\min}}\] <p>Since the <strong>total weight</strong> at round \(T+1\) is at least the weight of the best expert, we get:</p> \[W_{T+1} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{T+1, i} \geq w_{T+1, i^*} = \beta^{\mathcal{L}_T^{\min}}\] <p>Thus, the lower bound holds:</p> \[W_{T+1} \geq \beta^{\mathcal{L}_T^{\min}}\] <p>This ensures that the total weight does not shrink too fast, preserving a lower bound based on the best expert’s performance.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Step 4: Taking Logarithms</strong> Taking the logarithm of both bounds:</p> \[\log W_{T+1} = \log N + \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log (1 - (1 - \beta) L_t)\] <p>For the second term, using the inequality \(\log(1 - x) \leq -x\) for \(x &lt; 1\), we get:</p> \[\sum_{t=1}^{T} \log (1 - (1 - \beta) L_t) \leq \sum_{t=1}^{T} - (1 - \beta) L_T = - (1 - \beta) \mathcal{L}_T\] <p>Thus,</p> \[\log W_{T+1} \leq \log N - (1 - \beta) \mathcal{L}_T.\] <p>Similarly, for the lower bound:</p> \[\log W_{T+1} \geq \mathcal{L}_T^{\min} \log \beta\] <p>Combining these,</p> \[\mathcal{L}_T^{\min} \log \beta \leq \log N - (1 - \beta) \mathcal{L}_T.\] <p>Rearranging,</p> \[\mathcal{L}_T \leq \frac{\log N}{1 - \beta} - \frac{\log \beta}{1 - \beta} \mathcal{L}_T^{\min}\] \[\mathcal{L}_T \leq \log N - \frac{\log (1 - (1 - \beta))}{1 - \beta} \mathcal{L}_T^{\min}\] <p>Again, for this second term, using the inequality \(-\log(1 - x) \leq x+x^2\) for \(x \in [0, \frac{1}{2}]\), we get:</p> \[\mathcal{L}_T \leq \frac{\log N}{1 - \beta} + (2 - \beta) \mathcal{L}_T^{\min} \tag{1}\] <p>This is the main result, and it provides a clear bound on the cumulative loss \(\mathcal{L}_T\).</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Step 5: Choosing Optimal \(\beta\)</strong></p> <p>We differentiate with respect to \(\beta\) and setting it to zero gives:</p> \[\frac{\log N}{(1 - \beta)^2} - T = 0\] <p>Solving for \(\beta\):</p> \[\beta = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{\log N}{T}} &lt; 1\] <p>If \(1 - \sqrt{\frac{\log N}{T}} \geq \frac{1}{2}\), then:</p> \[\beta_0 = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{\log N}{T}}\] <p>Otherwise, we use the boundary value \(\beta_0 = \frac{1}{2}\) is the optimal value.</p> <p>Substituting this choice in \((1)\), we get:</p> \[\mathcal{L}_T \leq \mathcal{L}_T^{\min} + 2\sqrt{T \log N} \tag{2}\] <p>Thus, the <strong>regret bound</strong> is:</p> \[R_T = \mathcal{L}_T - \mathcal{L}_T^{\min} \leq 2 \sqrt{T \log N}\] <p><strong>Key Essence:</strong></p> <ul> <li>The <strong>regret</strong> of the RWM algorithm is \(O(\sqrt{T \log N})\).</li> <li>The <strong>average regret per round \(R_T/T\)</strong> decreases as \(O(1/\sqrt{T})\).</li> </ul> <p>This result shows that RWM achieves <strong>sublinear regret</strong>, meaning that as the number of rounds \(T\) grows, the algorithm performs almost as well as the best expert.</p> <hr/> <p>Do we really grasp what this formula is conveying? It highlights a remarkable bound in online learning. Alright, let’s dig into that further.</p> <p><strong>What does sublinear regret mean?</strong></p> <p>When we say that an algorithm has <strong>sublinear regret</strong>, we mean that the total regret <strong>grows slower than the number of rounds</strong>. As the number of rounds \(T\) increases, the gap between the algorithm’s performance and the best expert’s performance doesn’t increase linearly. Instead, it grows at a slower rate (e.g., \(\sqrt{T}\)).</p> <p><strong>The meaning of the formula:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Regret \(O(\sqrt{T \log N})\)</strong>: This tells you that after \(T\) rounds, the total regret will grow roughly as \(\sqrt{T}\), with an additional logarithmic factor based on \(N\) (the number of possible actions). The logarithmic term grows slowly and doesn’t significantly affect the overall growth for large \(T\).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Average regret per round \(O(1/\sqrt{T})\)</strong>: This shows that, on average, the regret per round decreases as the number of rounds increases. As \(T\) gets larger, the average regret (the loss per round) decreases.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Sublinear regret in action:</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>At the start</strong>, when the algorithm has few rounds to learn, it might perform poorly (larger regret).</li> <li><strong>Over time</strong>, as \(T\) grows, the algorithm’s performance improves. It makes fewer mistakes as it “learns” from past rounds, and the regret per round decreases.</li> <li><strong>After many rounds</strong>, the algorithm performs almost as well as the best possible action, and the regret becomes quite small.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Sublinear regret</strong> means that the algorithm’s performance gets closer to the best possible action as the number of rounds increases, but it does so at a slower pace than linear growth. The algorithm doesn’t just keep getting worse with more rounds; instead, it converges toward optimal performance.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The bound \((2)\) assumes that the algorithm additionally receives as a parameter the number of rounds \(T\). However, as we learned from the <a href="https://monishver11.github.io/blog/2025/doubling-trick/">Doubling trick</a> in the previous blog, this requirement can be relaxed at the cost of a small constant factor increase.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5> <p>The <strong>Randomized Weighted Majority (RWM) Algorithm</strong> provides a powerful and efficient method for decision-making and prediction in online learning. The regret bound we’ve derived shows that, under the right conditions, the RWM algorithm can perform nearly as well as the best possible expert in hindsight, with a regret that grows at most as \(O(\sqrt{T \log N})\).</p> <p>This result is optimal, as demonstrated by further lower bound theorems, and provides a strong theoretical guarantee for the RWM algorithm’s performance in practice.</p> <h5 id="references"><strong>References</strong></h5>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ADV-ML-NYU"/><category term="ML"/><category term="Math"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learn how the Randomized Weighted Majority (RWM) Algorithm leverages probabilistic prediction to minimize regret and defend against adversarial strategies in online learning environments.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bayesian Decision Theory - Concepts and Recap</title><link href="https://monishver11.github.io/blog/2025/bayes-decision-theory/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bayesian Decision Theory - Concepts and Recap"/><published>2025-01-28T16:18:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-28T16:18:00+00:00</updated><id>https://monishver11.github.io/blog/2025/bayes-decision-theory</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://monishver11.github.io/blog/2025/bayes-decision-theory/"><![CDATA[<p>Bayesian decision theory is a powerful framework for making decisions under uncertainty.

Next, we have the <strong>prior distribution</strong>, \(p(\theta)\), which encodes our beliefs about \(\theta\) before observing any data. This prior serves as a starting point in the Bayesian framework.</p> <p>Equally important is the <strong>action space</strong>, \(A\), which includes all possible actions we might take. To evaluate these actions, we rely on a <strong>loss function</strong>, \(\ell : A \times \Theta \to \mathbb{R}\), which quantifies the cost of taking a specific action \(a \in A\) when the true parameter value is \(\theta \in \Theta\).</p> <p>With these components, we can define the <strong>posterior risk</strong> of an action \(a \in A\), which represents the expected loss under the posterior distribution:</p> \[r(a) = \mathbb{E}[\ell(\theta, a) \mid D] = \int \ell(\theta, a) p(\theta \mid D) d\theta\] <p>The goal is to minimize this risk. The action that achieves this minimization is called the <strong>Bayes action</strong>, \(a^*\), which satisfies:</p> \[r(a^*) = \min_{a \in A} r(a)\] <h5 id="bayesian-point-estimation"><strong>Bayesian Point Estimation</strong></h5> <p>Bayesian point estimation builds upon this foundation. Imagine we have data \(D\) generated from some distribution \(p(y \mid \theta)\), where \(\theta \in \Theta\) is unknown. Our task is to find a single point estimate, \(\hat{\theta}\), that best represents \(\theta\).</p> <p>To do this, we first specify a prior distribution \(p(\theta)\) over \(\Theta\), which reflects our beliefs about \(\theta\) before observing the data. We then define a loss function, \(\ell(\hat{\theta}, \theta)\), to measure the cost of estimating \(\theta\) with \(\hat{\theta}\). Finally, we seek the point estimate \(\hat{\theta} \in \Theta\) that minimizes the posterior risk:</p> \[r(\hat{\theta}) = \mathbb{E}[\ell(\hat{\theta}, \theta) \mid D] = \int \ell(\hat{\theta}, \theta) p(\theta \mid D) d\theta.\] <h5 id="important-loss-functions-and-their-role"><strong>Important Loss Functions and Their Role</strong></h5> <p>The choice of loss function significantly influences the optimal estimate. Here are three commonly used loss functions and the corresponding Bayes actions:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Squared Loss</strong>: \(\ell(\hat{\theta}, \theta) = (\theta - \hat{\theta})^2\).<br/> For squared loss, the Bayes action is the <strong>posterior mean</strong>, \(\mathbb{E}[\theta \mid D]\).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Zero-One Loss</strong>: \(\ell(\hat{\theta}, \theta) = 1[\theta \neq \hat{\theta}]\).<br/> For zero-one loss, the Bayes action is the <strong>posterior mode</strong>, the most probable value of \(\theta\) under the posterior.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Absolute Loss</strong>: \(\ell(\hat{\theta}, \theta) = |\theta - \hat{\theta}|\).<br/> For absolute loss, the Bayes action is the <strong>posterior median</strong>, the value that splits the posterior distribution into two equal halves.</p> </li> </ul> <h5 id="example-card-drawing"><strong>Example: Card Drawing</strong></h5> <p>To see this in action, consider drawing a card from a deck consisting of the values \(\{2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5\}\). Suppose you are asked to guess the value of the card. Based on the posterior distribution:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>mean</strong> of the distribution is \(3.875\).</li> <li>The <strong>mode</strong> (most frequent value) is \(5\).</li> <li>The <strong>median</strong> (middle value) is \(4\).</li> </ul> <p>This simple example highlights how different loss functions lead to different optimal estimates.</p> <h5 id="bayesian-point-estimation-with-squared-loss"><strong>Bayesian Point Estimation with Squared Loss</strong></h5> <p>We seek an action \(\hat{\theta}\) that minimizes the <strong>posterior risk</strong>, given by:</p> \[r(\hat{\theta}) = \int (\theta - \hat{\theta})^2 p(\theta | \mathcal{D}) \, d\theta\] <p>To find the optimal \(\hat{\theta}\), we differentiate:</p> \[\frac{d r(\hat{\theta})}{d\hat{\theta}} = - \int 2 (\theta - \hat{\theta}) p(\theta | \mathcal{D}) \, d\theta\] <p>Rearranging,</p> \[= -2 \int \theta p(\theta | \mathcal{D}) \, d\theta + 2\hat{\theta} \int p(\theta | \mathcal{D}) \, d\theta\] <p>Since the total probability integrates to 1,</p> \[\int p(\theta | \mathcal{D}) \, d\theta = 1,\] <p>this simplifies to:</p> \[\frac{d r(\hat{\theta})}{d\hat{\theta}} = -2 \int \theta p(\theta | \mathcal{D}) \, d\theta + 2\hat{\theta}\] <p>Setting the derivative to zero,</p> \[-2 \int \theta p(\theta | \mathcal{D}) \, d\theta + 2\hat{\theta} = 0\] <p>Solving for \(\hat{\theta}\),</p> \[\hat{\theta} = \int \theta p(\theta \mid D) d\theta = \mathbb{E}[\theta \mid D]\] <p>Thus, under squared loss, the Bayes action is the <strong>posterior mean</strong>.</p> <hr/> <h4 id="recap-and-interpretation"><strong>Recap and Interpretation</strong></h4> <p>Bayesian Decision Theory is built on a few core ideas that tie together probability, decision-making, and inference. Let’s revisit these concepts and unpack their meaning(again) all at once to gain the full picture.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you feel this isn’t necessary, feel free to skip it. However, I believe it’s helpful to reinforce these concepts periodically to build strong intuition and apply them effectively when needed.</p> <h5 id="the-prior-ptheta"><strong>The Prior (\(p(\theta)\))</strong></h5> <p>The prior represents our initial beliefs about the unknown parameter \(\theta\) before observing any data. It encapsulates what we know (or assume) about \(\theta\) based on prior knowledge, expert opinion, or historical data.</p> <p>For example, if \(\theta\) represents the probability of success in a coin toss, a reasonable prior might be a Beta distribution centered around 0.5, reflecting our belief that the coin is fair.</p> <h5 id="the-posterior-ptheta-mid-d"><strong>The Posterior (\(p(\theta \mid D)\))</strong></h5> <p>The posterior is the updated belief about \(\theta\) after observing the data \(D\). It combines the prior \(p(\theta)\) with the likelihood of the data \(p(D \mid \theta)\) using Bayes’ theorem:</p> \[p(\theta \mid D) = \frac{p(D \mid \theta) p(\theta)}{p(D)}\] <p>The posterior is the foundation of all Bayesian inference. It reflects how the data has rationally updated our initial beliefs.</p> <h5 id="inferences-and-actions"><strong>Inferences and Actions</strong></h5> <p>In the Bayesian framework, all inferences (e.g., estimating \(\theta\)) and actions (e.g., making decisions) are based on the posterior distribution. This is because the posterior contains all the information we have about \(\theta\), combining both prior knowledge and observed data.</p> <p>For example, if we want to estimate \(\theta\), we might compute the posterior mean, median, or mode, depending on the loss function we choose.</p> <h5 id="no-need-to-justify-an-estimator"><strong>No Need to Justify an Estimator</strong></h5> <p>In classical statistics, we often need to justify why a particular estimator (e.g., the sample mean) is a good choice. In Bayesian statistics, this issue doesn’t arise because the estimator is derived directly from the posterior distribution, which is fully determined by the prior and the data.</p> <p>The only choices we need to make are:</p> <ol> <li>The family of distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Beta) that model the data.</li> <li>The prior distribution on the parameter space \(\Theta\).</li> </ol> <p><strong>Role of the Loss Function</strong></p> <p>The loss function \(\ell(a, \theta)\) quantifies the cost of taking action \(a\) when the true parameter is \(\theta\). It bridges the gap between inference and decision-making.</p> <p>The optimal action \(a^*\) is the one that minimizes the posterior risk, which is the expected loss under the posterior distribution:</p> \[r(a) = \mathbb{E}[\ell(a, \theta) \mid D] = \int \ell(a, \theta) p(\theta \mid D) \, d\theta\] <p>Different loss functions lead to different optimal actions. For example:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Squared loss</strong> leads to the posterior mean.</li> <li><strong>Absolute loss</strong> leads to the posterior median.</li> <li><strong>Zero-one loss</strong> leads to the posterior mode.</li> </ul> <h5 id="philosophical-interpretation"><strong>Philosophical Interpretation</strong></h5> <p>Bayesian Decision Theory is fundamentally about rational decision-making under uncertainty. It provides a coherent framework for updating beliefs and making decisions that minimize expected loss.</p> <p>Unlike frequentist methods, which focus on long-run properties of estimators, Bayesian methods focus on the current state of knowledge, as represented by the posterior distribution.</p> <h5 id="why-does-this-matter"><strong>Why Does This Matter?</strong></h5> <p>Understanding these concepts is crucial because they form the backbone of Bayesian thinking. Here’s why:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: The Bayesian approach allows us to incorporate prior knowledge into our analysis, which can be especially useful when data is limited.</li> <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: All assumptions (e.g., the choice of prior) are explicitly stated, making the analysis transparent and interpretable.</li> <li><strong>Decision-Oriented</strong>: By focusing on minimizing expected loss, Bayesian Decision Theory directly addresses the practical goal of making optimal decisions.</li> </ol> <h5 id="example-estimating-the-mean-of-a-normal-distribution"><strong>Example: Estimating the Mean of a Normal Distribution</strong></h5> <p>Suppose we want to estimate the mean \(\theta\) of a normal distribution based on observed data \(D\). Here’s how the Bayesian approach works:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Prior</strong>: We choose a normal prior \(p(\theta) = N(\mu_0, \sigma_0^2)\), where \(\mu_0\) and \(\sigma_0^2\) reflect our initial beliefs about \(\theta\).</li> <li><strong>Likelihood</strong>: The data \(D\) is modeled as \(p(D \mid \theta) = N(\theta, \sigma^2)\).</li> <li><strong>Posterior</strong>: Using Bayes’ theorem, the posterior \(p(\theta \mid D)\) is also a normal distribution, with updated mean and variance that balance the prior and the data.</li> <li><strong>Decision</strong>: If we use squared loss, the optimal estimate \(\hat{\theta}\) is the posterior mean.</li> </ol> <p>This example illustrates how the Bayesian approach seamlessly integrates prior knowledge with observed data to produce a rational and optimal estimate.</p> <h5 id="example-estimating-the-mean-of-a-normal-distribution-frequentist-approach"><strong>Example: Estimating the Mean of a Normal Distribution (Frequentist Approach)</strong></h5> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Model Assumption</strong>:<br/> Assume the data \(D\) comes from a normal distribution: \(p(D \mid \theta) = N(\theta, \sigma^2),\)<br/> where \(\theta\) is the unknown mean and \(\sigma^2\) is the known variance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Estimator</strong>:<br/> Use the sample mean: \(\bar{D} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n D_i\)<br/> as the estimator for \(\theta\). This is derived as the <strong>maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)</strong> because it maximizes the likelihood function:</p> \[L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(D_i \mid \theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(D_i - \theta)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right).\] </li> <li><strong>Properties of the Estimator</strong>: <ul> <li>The sample mean \(\bar{D}\) is an <strong>unbiased estimator</strong> of \(\theta\), meaning: \(E[\bar{D}] = \theta.\)</li> <li>Its variance is: \(\text{Var}(\bar{D}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n},\)<br/> which decreases as the sample size \(n\) increases.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Decision</strong>:<br/> The sample mean \(\bar{D}\) is reported as the estimate of \(\theta\). There is no explicit loss function in the frequentist framework; instead, the sample mean is justified by its desirable properties (e.g., unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency).</li> </ol> <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’re unsure about this derivation from MLE, check out this <a href="https://monishver11.github.io/blog/2025/NB-continuous-features/">link</a> for clarification.</p> <p><strong><mark>Key Takeaways</mark></strong></p> <ol> <li>The prior represents initial beliefs, the posterior represents updated beliefs, and the loss function guides decision-making.</li> <li>Bayesian methods are inherently decision-oriented, focusing on minimizing expected loss.</li> <li>The only choices we need to make are the family of distributions and the prior—everything else follows logically from these choices.</li> </ol> <hr/> <p>A few follow-up questions you might have:</p> <h5 id="explanation-of-actionsdecision-making"><strong>Explanation of “Actions/Decision-Making”</strong></h5> <p>In the Bayesian framework, <strong>actions</strong> or <strong>decision-making</strong> refer to the choices or decisions we make based on the information encoded in the posterior distribution. These decisions could range from estimating a parameter to choosing between different courses of action based on the expected outcomes.</p> <p>For example:</p> <ul> <li>If you’re estimating a parameter \(\theta\), the <strong>action</strong> could be selecting the posterior mean, median, or mode as your estimate.</li> <li>If you’re deciding whether to launch a product, the <strong>action</strong> could involve calculating the probability of success using the posterior and deciding based on a predefined threshold.</li> <li>In medical diagnostics, the <strong>action</strong> could be choosing a treatment plan based on the likelihood of a disease inferred from the posterior.</li> </ul> <p>In essence, <strong>actions</strong> are the outcomes of the decision-making process, guided by the posterior distribution and a loss function that quantifies the cost of making an incorrect decision.</p> <h5 id="what-is-an-estimator-in-the-frequentist-approach"><strong>What is an “Estimator” in the frequentist approach?</strong></h5> <p>An <strong>estimator</strong> is a statistical function or rule used to estimate an unknown parameter \(\theta\) based on observed data. In frequentist statistics, estimators are often chosen based on their theoretical properties, such as:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Unbiasedness</strong>: The estimator’s expected value equals the true parameter value.</li> <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: The estimator has the smallest possible variance among all unbiased estimators.</li> <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: The estimator converges to the true parameter value as the sample size increases.</li> </ul> <p>For example:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>sample mean</strong> is a common estimator for the population mean.</li> <li>The <strong>sample variance</strong> is an estimator for the population variance.</li> </ul> <p>In Bayesian statistics, however, the <strong>estimator</strong> is derived directly from the posterior distribution. For instance:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>posterior mean</strong> minimizes squared error loss.</li> <li>The <strong>posterior median</strong> minimizes absolute error loss.</li> <li>The <strong>posterior mode</strong> corresponds to the most likely value of \(\theta\).</li> </ul> <p>The key difference is that Bayesian methods do not require separate justification for an estimator because the posterior distribution naturally incorporates both the prior beliefs and observed data, making the choice of estimator a consequence of the decision-making process.</p> <hr/> <p>We’ve covered most of it, right? Now, let’s revisit the foundational concepts that underpin everything we’ve discussed so far, including conditional probability, the likelihood function, and MLE in a general sense.</p> <h5 id="conditional-probability-modeling"><strong>Conditional Probability Modeling</strong></h5> <p>In this context, we have:</p> <ul> <li>An <strong>input space</strong>, \(X\), which represents the features or predictors.</li> <li>An <strong>outcome space</strong>, \(Y\), which represents the possible outputs.</li> <li>An <strong>action space</strong>, \(A\), consisting of probability distributions on \(Y\).</li> </ul> <p>A prediction function \(f : X \to A\) maps each input \(x \in X\) to a distribution on \(Y\). This setup allows us to model the relationship between inputs and outputs probabilistically.</p> <p>In a parametric framework, we define a family of conditional densities:</p> \[\{p(y \mid x, \theta) : \theta \in \Theta\},\] <p>where \(p(y \mid x, \theta)\) is a density on \(Y\) for each \(x \in X\), and \(\theta\) is a parameter in the finite-dimensional space \(\Theta\). This is the common starting point for either classical or Bayesian regression.</p> <h5 id="classical-treatment-likelihood-function"><strong>Classical Treatment: Likelihood Function</strong></h5> <p>In the classical approach, we begin with data \(D = (y_1, \dots, y_n)\) and assume it is generated by the conditional density \(p(y \mid x, \theta)\). The probability of the data is:</p> \[p(D \mid x_1, \dots, x_n, \theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i \mid x_i, \theta)\] <p>For fixed \(D\), the likelihood function is defined as:</p> \[L_D(\theta) = p(D \mid x, \theta),\] <p>where \(x = (x_1, \dots, x_n)\).</p> <h5 id="maximum-likelihood-estimator-mle"><strong>Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)</strong></h5> <p>The <strong>Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)</strong> for \(\theta\) is the value that maximizes the likelihood function:</p> \[\hat{\theta}_{\text{MLE}} = \arg\max_{\theta \in \Theta} L_D(\theta)\] <p>Interestingly, MLE corresponds to <strong>Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)</strong> if we set the loss function to the negative log-likelihood. The resulting prediction function is:</p> \[\hat{f}(x) = p(y \mid x, \hat{\theta}_{\text{MLE}})\] <hr/> <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5> <p>So, we’ve reached the end of this blog. I know it can be confusing at times—I’ve been confused too—but take your time to get a solid grasp on it. This is the foundation of Bayesian ML. In the past few blogs, we’ve discussed these concepts, but do you recall if we’ve applied them to any prediction tasks yet? The answer is no. In the next one, we’ll put them into practice through Bayesian conditional models.</p> <h5 id="references"><strong>References</strong></h5>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ML-NYU"/><category term="ML"/><category term="Math"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A comprehensive guide to Bayesian decision theory, exploring its key components, point estimation, loss functions, and connections to classical probability modeling.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reinforcement Learning - An Introductory Guide</title><link href="https://monishver11.github.io/blog/2025/rl-intro/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reinforcement Learning - An Introductory Guide"/><published>2025-01-28T03:45:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-28T03:45:00+00:00</updated><id>https://monishver11.github.io/blog/2025/rl-intro</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://monishver11.github.io/blog/2025/rl-intro/"><![CDATA[<p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a fascinating field that focuses on teaching agents how to make decisions based on their environment. The agent’s goal is to learn a strategy that maximizes a cumulative reward over time by interacting with its surroundings. But before we dive into the details of RL, let’s explore the fundamental concepts of decision-making and intelligence.</p> <h5 id="what-is-decision-making"><strong>What is Decision Making?</strong></h5> <p>At its core, decision-making is the process of choosing the best possible action from a set of alternatives. It lies at the heart of intelligence and is fundamental to building intelligent systems.</p> <h5 id="what-is-intelligence"><strong>What is Intelligence?</strong></h5> <p>Intelligence can be broadly defined as the ability to:</p> <ul> <li>Understand and process what’s happening around you.</li> <li>Make informed decisions.</li> <li>Reason and analyze complex situations.</li> </ul> <p>In simpler terms, intelligence enables us to learn, adapt, and tackle new or challenging scenarios effectively.</p> <h5 id="why-intelligence-and-how-does-it-work"><strong>Why Intelligence and How Does It Work?</strong></h5> <p>A strong driving force for the evolution of intelligence is survival. For instance, early single-celled organisms relied on simple hunting strategies. Over time, the emergence of multicellular organisms, like <em>C. elegans</em>, marked a leap in complexity. They developed neurons, enabling coordination and more sophisticated strategies.</p> <p>While the exact mechanisms of intelligence remain elusive, certain principles stand out:</p> <ul> <li>Neurons form the foundation of biological intelligence.</li> <li>Artificial neural networks via backpropagation, despite their inspiration from biology, cannot replicate human intelligence <strong>yet</strong>.</li> <li>Understanding the principles of intelligence is arguably more important than mimicking its mechanisms.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h4 id="six-lessons-from-babies"><strong>Six Lessons from Babies</strong></h4> <p>Developmental psychology offers valuable insights into intelligence. Here are six key lessons we can learn from how babies develop:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Be Multimodal</strong>: Babies combine sensory inputs (sight, sound, touch, etc.) to create a cohesive understanding of their environment.</li> <li><strong>Be Incremental</strong>: Learning is gradual. Babies adapt as they encounter new information. <ul> <li>Unlike i.i.d. data in supervised learning, real-world learning is sequential and non-i.i.d., posing unique challenges.</li> <li>RL algorithms often simulate i.i.d.-like scenarios to work effectively.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Be Physical</strong>: Interaction with the environment is crucial. Babies learn by manipulating objects and observing the outcomes.</li> <li><strong>Explore</strong>: Exploration is central to learning. Babies experiment with their surroundings to gather information and refine their actions.</li> <li><strong>Be Social</strong>: Social interactions play a significant role. Babies learn by observing and imitating others.</li> <li><strong>Learn a Language</strong>: Language serves as a symbolic framework to organize thoughts and retrieve information efficiently.</li> </ol> <p>These principles are directly relevant to reinforcement learning (RL), where agents learn by interacting with and exploring their environment.</p> <h5 id="takeaways-thus-far"><strong>Takeaways Thus Far;</strong></h5> <ul> <li>Intelligence is fundamentally rooted in decision-making.</li> <li>Decision-making occurs at various levels, from low-level motor control to high-level reasoning and coordination.</li> <li>Algorithms for decision-making depend heavily on the specific task.</li> <li>Neuroscience, motor control, and cognitive psychology provide valuable insights for designing intelligent systems.</li> <li>Translating biological insights into computational systems remains challenging due to a lack of foundational understanding.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h4 id="a-computational-lens-on-decision-making"><strong>A Computational Lens on Decision Making</strong></h4> <p>Decision-making can be viewed through the following computational frameworks:</p> <h5 id="from-an-agents-perspective"><strong>From an Agent’s Perspective:</strong></h5> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-7 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Agent_Persepective-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Agent_Persepective-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Agent_Persepective-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/Agent_Persepective.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Agent_Persepective" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <ol> <li>Sense</li> <li>Think</li> <li>Act</li> <li>Repeat</li> </ol> <h5 id="from-a-global-perspective"><strong>From a Global Perspective:</strong></h5> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-7 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Global_Persepective-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Global_Persepective-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Global_Persepective-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/Global_Persepective.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Global_Persepective" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <ol> <li>Observations</li> <li>Sense → Think → Act</li> <li>Effects of Actions</li> <li>Repeat</li> </ol> <p>Alternate terminologies for decision-making systems include policy, strategy, and controller.</p> <h5 id="examples-of-computational-decision-making"><strong>Examples of Computational Decision Making</strong></h5> <ul> <li><strong>Atari Games (Deep RL)</strong>: Agents maximize scores by analyzing game frames and selecting actions accordingly.</li> <li><strong>Google Robots</strong>: Robots perform complex tasks using intricate joint control mechanisms.</li> <li><strong>Go</strong>: RL has enabled agents to outperform humans in this game with a vast decision space.</li> <li><strong>Dota 2</strong>: RL systems have been trained to defeat top human players by optimizing strategies in a dynamic environment.

This sequence can be represented as:</p> \[(o_1, a_1, r_1) \to (o_2, a_2, r_2) \to \dots \to (o_n, a_n, r_n)\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>\(o_t\): Observation at time \(t\),</li> <li>\(a_t\): Action taken at time \(t\),</li> <li>\(r_t\): Reward received after taking action \(a_t\).</li> </ul> <p>The objective is to maximize the cumulative reward:</p> \[\max_{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{T-1}} \sum_{t=1}^{T} r_t\] <p>The key challenge is determining the optimal actions \(a_t\) at each time step to achieve the maximum long-term reward. This leads to the concept of <em>policy optimization</em>.</p> <h5 id="planning-and-world-models"><strong>Planning and World Models</strong></h5> <p>Another approach to decision-making is through planning, where the agent uses a model of the world to simulate the effects of its actions. This allows the agent to reason about potential future states and make decisions accordingly.</p> <p>However, planning is limited in its applicability:</p> <ul> <li>It works well in discrete, well-defined environments like games.</li> <li>It struggles with complex, dynamic tasks like conversational AI or real-world robotics.</li> </ul> <h5 id="the-limits-of-current-approaches"><strong>The Limits of Current Approaches</strong></h5> <p>Despite their potential, RL and planning-based models face significant challenges:</p> <ul> <li>Real-world scenarios often lack the i.i.d. assumption that RL sometime relies on.</li> <li>Bridging the gap between controlled simulations and dynamic real-world environments remains a key hurdle.</li> </ul> <h5 id="a-note-of-caution-amidst-progress"><strong>A Note of Caution Amidst Progress</strong></h5> <p>While reinforcement learning and computational decision-making have seen remarkable progress, it’s important to recognize the challenges that remain. This brings us to <strong>Moravec’s Paradox</strong>, a fascinating insight into the nature of artificial intelligence:</p> <blockquote> <p>“It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult-level performance on intelligence tests or play games like chess, yet it is extremely difficult to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.”<br/> — <strong>Hans Moravec, 1988</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Steven Pinker elaborated further:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy, and the easy problems are hard.”<br/> — <strong>Steven Pinker, 1994</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>What this paradox highlights is that tasks humans find effortless—such as walking, recognizing faces, or interacting physically with the environment—require immense computational power and intricate modeling to replicate in machines. Conversely, tasks like playing chess, solving mathematical problems, or optimizing game strategies are relatively easier for computers.</p> <p>This paradox underscores the fact that intelligence, especially in its perceptual and physical forms, is deeply rooted in evolutionary processes. The interplay of sensory data, motor control, and real-world adaptation—elements essential for robust intelligence—remains a significant challenge for machines.</p> <p>In reinforcement learning, we see this reflected in the difficulty of training agents to generalize to unstructured, real-world environments. RL agents perform admirably in games like <strong>Atari</strong> or <strong>Go</strong>, but replicating even the basic capabilities of a human child—like balancing on uneven surfaces or adapting to novel stimuli—remains an open frontier.</p> <hr/> <h5 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5> <p>Reinforcement learning provides a powerful framework for decision-making, allowing agents to learn from their interactions with the environment. By leveraging concepts such as reward mechanisms, policy optimization, and planning, we have achieved significant milestones in fields like gaming, robotics, and autonomous systems.</p> <p>However, the journey toward creating truly intelligent systems is far from over. While computational models continue to evolve, there is a need for a deeper understanding of the principles of intelligence, both biological and artificial.</p> <p>As we wrap up this introduction to reinforcement learning and decision-making, it’s clear that intelligence is fundamentally about making informed decisions. Whether through supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or planning, the goal remains the same: enabling machines to reason, adapt, and thrive in dynamic environments.</p> <p>In the next post, we’ll dive deeper into decision-making in supervised learning and explore how it serves as the foundation for many modern AI systems.
