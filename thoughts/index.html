Some may be inspired by others, and you might find connections to different ideas or directly to individuals, which I find relatable and interesting. I feel most of them arise from the human-made complexities of life, which is something we’re doomed to live by with all its richness.</p> <p>Some of it could be happy, sad, or whatever form human emotions may take, and these thoughts could take any of those forms when I pen them down. The exact thought is forever with the one penning it down, for god knows what reason.</p> <p>Everyone sees life through their unique lens and the experiences they’ve gained in the time being, and that opens and closes doors for them to move forward. I wish more people took the time to see more holistically what life has to offer.</p> <p>This is my way of sharing my learnings as I navigate and explore this world for all it has to offer.</p> <p>I truly believe there are people out there who will resonate with one another, even in the slightest ways and that’s the beauty of it. We’re all unique in subtle ways, yet often separated by distances for which we haven’t found meaningful ways to bridge connection.</p> <p>So, if you have thoughts that are raw, genuine, and come from a place that doesn’t intend harm - express them.</p> <p>As it’s said: this is life, your life, and your only life - so live it to the fullest.</p> <hr> <h6 id="july-2025"><strong>July 2025</strong></h6> <div class="small-quote"> <p>Today, human actions aren’t bound by the universality of nature as they used to be. But if we can possibly and unitedly agree on at least one thing, then it’s attainable and leads to a better balance.</p> </div> <div class="small-quote"> <p>You may find yourself to be a culmination of different personalities that resonate, relate, admire, hate, and have likes and dislikes similar to you. Similarly, some may find parts of you within them, and if you attain fame, more people may find your pieces in them. So, if you take all of them and piece them together, there is no way to connect them all to make you the way you are. That missing connection is your unique personality that you need to build and strengthen.</p> </div> <div class="small-quote"> <p>Right intent protects you. It’s like the shade that assists you in your long, hard path. It also inhibits unwanted thoughts that may drain your energy.</p> </div> <div class="small-quote"> <p>Find your interpretation of ‘Balance’. For someone, following a proper routine is balance. At the same time, there is someone who works tirelessly for days and then takes the same amount as rest. Both may be odd and extreme to each other, but that is what they find to be balance for them—and neither is wrong. Find your sweet spot.</p> </div> <div class="small-quote"> <p><strong>We really don’t have to worry about anything that’s on the emotional side as long as the sun’s gonna rise the next morning.
